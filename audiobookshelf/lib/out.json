No enemy has ever made it across the Long Bridge or penetrated the city's mighty walls. Even when a powerful invading army shows up at the gates, the duke and his daughter, Rina Veraiin, are certain that it poses little threat. But they are cruelly betrayed from within and, in a horrific spasm of violence, the city is brought to its knees. With the help of her bodyguard, Kork, the battle-trained young Rina narrowly escapes the slaughter and makes her way to the lair of an ancient sorcerer - the Ink Mage - who gifts her with a strange, beautiful set of magical tattoos. Now a duchess in exile, Rina sets out on a quest to reclaim what is rightfully hers, aided by a motley assortment of followers who will help her in her cause - some for noble reasons and others for their own dark purposes. With the enemy's agents nipping at her heels, Rina must learn to harness her new and startling magical powers if she is to assert her rightful place as ruler of Klaar.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw09db9v/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction &

The Beginning After the End series.  Beckoning Fates (book 3): Was I taking this life for granted? Having this amount of power at my age had made me lose some of the sense of rationality I’d had in my former life. No longer a king, no longer tied down by rules and politics, I’d become careless. In this world, my potential was boundless. Though Arthur Leywin would like nothing more than to pursue his studies at the esteemed Xyrus Academy, where he hopes to push his already potent magical abilities to new plateaus and perhaps discover something more about his reincarnation into this world, he finds the politics of the school’s halls even more challenging to navigate than those of the council chambers he once inhabited as King Grey. Arthur faces inept professors, jealous classmates, and an overeager director while fending off the affection of an old friend and the aggression of an old enemy. Then a routine class trip into a low-level dungeon turns out to be anything but, and Arthur discovers something that will change his life forever. Horizon's Edge (book 4): In my past life I hadn’t had anyone I would have given my life to protect. I had that now, but I didn’t have the strength to protect them - not against what was about to come. In another life, Arthur Leywin was a king and no stranger to war. He was not ready, however, to find himself at the heart of a conflict that will reshape his entire new world. Despite his abilities, it seems as if the danger only increases with every discovery he makes. His oldest friend succumbs to a power that may destroy her, a power Arthur gave her.

Growing up in an environment where no one truly loved me - and, in turn, being callous and distant to everyone - made me an unrivaled fighter, but a crappy person. When I came to this world, my new parents taught me something I'd never known. I may not be the strongest fighter or mage in this world, but I'm a hell of a lot better person now than I ever would've been in my previous life. In order to protect his loved ones, the mage Arthur Leywin must reveal the truth of his identity. If he is to fulfill his role in the war between the godlike asuras and the demonic Vritra, he must leave those he hopes to protect and travel to the land of deities and dragons.  First, however, he must escape. Arthur stands before the kings and queens of Dicathen, accused of a crime he did not commit. It will take an act of the gods to save him from having his magic stripped away, leaving him powerless in the war to come. Fortunately for Arthur, he can count the gods among his friends.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0a3znj/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction &

African-inspired fantasy debut. They killed my mother. They took our magic. They tried to bury us. Now we rise. Zélie Adebola remembers when the soil of Orïsha hummed with magic. Burners ignited flames, Tiders beckoned waves, and Zélie’s Reaper mother summoned forth souls. But everything changed the night magic disappeared. Under the orders of a ruthless king, maji were killed, leaving Zélie without a mother and her people without hope. Now Zélie has one chance to bring back magic and strike against the monarchy. With the help of a rogue princess, Zélie must outwit and outrun the crown prince, who is hell-bent on eradicating magic for good. Danger lurks in Orïsha, where snow leoponaires prowl and vengeful spirits wait in the waters. Yet the greatest danger may be Zélie herself as she struggles to control her powers - and her growing feelings for an enemy. Praise for Children of Blood and Bone: \"[Narrator Bahni Turpin] excels at customizing her voice to capture the unique personalities of each character....

But their rivalries divided them in endless battles for supremacy - until one dark lord at last united the Sith in the quest to enslave the galaxy and exterminate the Jedi. Yet it would fall to another, far more powerful than the entire Brotherhood of Darkness, to ultimately realize the full potential of the Sith and wield the awesome power of the dark side as never before. Since childhood, Dessel has known only the abuse of his hateful father and the dangerous, soul-crushing labor of a cortosis miner. Deep in the tunnels of the desolate planet Apatros, endlessly excavating the rare mineral valued throughout the galaxy, Dessel dreams of the day he can escape - a day he fears may never come. But when a high-stakes card game ends in deadly violence, Dessel suddenly finds himself a wanted man. On the run from vengeful Republic forces, Dessel vanishes into the ranks of the Sith army and ships out to join the bloody war against the Republic and its Jedi champions. There, Dessel’s brutality, cunning, and exceptional command of the Force swiftly win him renown as a warrior. But in the eyes of his watchful masters, he is destined for a far greater role in the ultimate Sith plan for the galaxy - if he can prove himself truly worthy. As an acolyte in the Sith academy, studying the secrets and skills of the dark side at the feet of its greatest masters, Dessel embraces his new Sith identity: Bane. However the true test is yet to come. In order to gain acceptance into the Brotherhood of Darkness, one must fully surrender to the dark side through a trial by fire that Bane, for all his unquenchable fury and lust for power, may not be strong enough to endure... especially since deception, treachery, and murder run rampant among the Sith disciples, and utter ruthlessness alone is the key to survival. Only by defying the most sacred traditions, rejecting all he has been taught, and drawing upon the long-forgotten wisdom of the very first Sith can Bane hope to triumph - and forge from the ashes of that which he must destroy a new era of absolute dark power.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0ecr0j/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1636996914842,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Star Wars/01 - Path of Destruction","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Star Wars/01 - Path of Destruction","addedAt":1636964426022,"lastUpdate":1636996914842,"duration":43797528,"size":257686388,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":2,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":23070.096,"title":"Path of Destruction 01"},{"id":1,"start":23070.096,"end":43797.528000000006,"title":"Path of Destruction 02"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0f9hdd","ino":"5422425122221363929","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","subtitle":null,"author":"Scott Lynch","authorFL":"Scott Lynch","authorLF":"Lynch, Scott","narrator":"Michael Page","series":"Gentleman Bastard Sequence","volumeNumber":"1","publishYear":"Scot","publisher":null,"description":"“Remarkable...Scott Lynch’s first novel, The Lies of Locke Lamora, exports the suspense and wit of a cleverly constructed crime caper into an exotic realm of fantasy, and the result is engagingly entertaining.” (The Times, London)  An orphan’s life is harsh - and often short - in the mysterious island city of Camorr. But young Locke Lamora dodges death and slavery, becoming a thief under the tutelage of a gifted con artist. As leader of the band of light-fingered brothers known as the Gentleman Bastards, Locke is soon infamous, fooling even the underworld’s most feared ruler. But in the shadows lurks someone still more ambitious and deadly. Faced with a bloody coup that threatens to destroy everyone and everything that holds meaning in his mercenary life, Locke vows to beat the enemy at his own brutal game - or die trying.  Praise for The Lies of Locke Lamora  “Fresh, original, and engrossing...gorgeously realized.” (George R. R. Martin)  “Right now, in the full flush of a second reading, I think The Lies of Locke Lamora is probably in my top ten favorite books ever. Maybe my top five. If you haven’t read it, you should. If you have read it, you should probably read it again.” (Patrick Rothfuss, New York Times best-selling author of The Name of the Wind) “High-octane fantasy...a great swashbuckling yarn of a novel.” (Richard Morgan)","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw0f9hdd/Cover.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Scott Lynch/The Lies of Locke Lamora/Cover.jpg","genres":["Literature & Fiction","Humor & Satire"],"lastUpdate":1636966108625,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Scott Lynch/The Lies of Locke Lamora","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Scott Lynch/The Lies of Locke Lamora","addedAt":1636965953080,"lastUpdate":1636966108625,"duration":79170543,"size":630649434,"ebooks":[{"ino":"10081958993332875913","filetype":"ebook","filename":"Lies of Locke Lamora, The -

\"one of the most important writers in 21st-century fantasy\" (Contra Costa Times) - continues her enthralling fantasy saga of dragons and their keepers. Once, dragons ruled the Rain Wilds, tended by privileged human servants known as Elderlings. But a series of cataclysmic eruptions nearly drove these magnificent creatures to extinction. Born weak and deformed, the last of their kind had one hope for survival: to return to their ancient city of Kelsingra. Accompanied by a disparate crew of untested young keepers, the dragons embarked on a harsh journey into the unknown along the toxic Rain Wild River. Battling starvation, a hostile climate, and treacherous enemies, dragons and humans began to forge magical connections, bonds that have wrought astonishing transformations for them all. And though Kelsingra is finally near, their odyssey has only begun. Because of the swollen waters of the Rain Wild River, the lost city can be reached only by flight - a test of endurance and skill beyond the stunted dragons’ strength. Venturing across the swift-running river in tiny boats, the dragon scholar Alise and a handful of keepers discover a world far different from anything they have ever known or imagined. Immense, ornate structures of black stone veined with silver and lifelike stone statues line the silent, eerily empty streets. Yet what are the whispers they hear, the shadows of voices and bursts of light that flutter and are gone? And why do they feel as if eyes are watching them? The dragons must plumb the depths of their ancestral memories to help them take flight and unlock the secrets buried in Kelsingra. But enemies driven by greed and dark desires are approaching. Time is running out, not only for the dragons but for their human keepers as well.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw0hk8vv/_City of Dragons_.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Robin Hobb/Rain Wilds 03 - City of Dragons/_City of Dragons_.jpg","genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637003829961,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Robin Hobb/Rain Wilds 03 - City of Dragons","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Robin Hobb/Rain Wilds 03 - City of Dragons","addedAt":1636969813945,"lastUpdate":1637003829961,"duration":45707478,"size":559732789,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":19,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":40.386,"title":"Book Intro"},{"id":1,"start":40.386,"end":1221.853,"title":"Book Prologue"},{"id":2,"start":1221.853,"end":2475.7830000000004,"title":"Ch 01"},{"id":3,"start":2475.7830000000004,"end":6069.24,"title":"Ch 02"},{"id":4,"start":6069.24,"end":9199.493999999999,"title":"Ch 03"},{"id":5,"start":9199.493999999999,"end":12091.458999999999,"title":"Ch 04"},{"id":6,"start":12091.458999999999,"end":14557.601999999999,"title":"Ch 05"},{"id":7,"start":14557.601999999999,"end":17197.379999999997,"title":"Ch 06"},{"id":8,"start":17197.379999999997,"end":19823.025999999998,"title":"Ch 07"},{"id":9,"start":19823.025999999998,"end":24193.181999999997,"title":"Ch 08"},{"id":10,"start":24193.181999999997,"end":27868.114999999998,"title":"Ch 09"},{"id":11,"start":27868.114999999998,"end":30903.335,"title":"Ch 10"},{"id":12,"start":30903.335,"end":34231.257,"title":"Ch 11"},{"id":13,"start":34231.257,"end":36631.911,"title":"Ch 12"},{"id":14,"start":36631.911,"end":38065.276,"title":"Ch 13"},{"id":15,"start":38065.276,"end":41322.797999999995,"title":"Ch 14"},{"id":16,"start":41322.797999999995,"end":44997.757,"title":"Ch 15"},{"id":17,"start":44997.757,"end":45630.678,"title":"Epilogue"},{"id":18,"start":45630.678,"end":45707.478,"title":"Final Credits"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0hmkqr","ino":"14342775558508959813","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Dragon Haven","subtitle":null,"author":"Robin Hobb","authorFL":"Robin Hobb","authorLF":"Hobb, Robin","narrator":"Anne Flosnik","series":"The Rain Wild Chronicles","volumeNumber":"2","publishYear":"2010","publisher":null,"description":"\"A full master of the epic fantasy.\" (Tulsa World) One of the world’s most acclaimed fantasists, New York Times best-selling author Robin Hobb returns to the world of her popular Tawny Man trilogy with Dragon Haven - the second book, following Dragon Keeper (\"Imaginative, literate, and compassionate from first page to last\" (Booklist)) in an epic adventure about the resurgence of dragons in a world that both needs and fears them.

More than 20 years ago, the first epic fantasy novel featuring FitzChivalry Farseer and his mysterious, often maddening friend the Fool struck like a bolt of brilliant lightning. Now New York Times best-selling author Robin Hobb brings to a momentous close the third trilogy featuring these beloved characters in a novel of unsurpassed artistry that is sure to endure as one of the great masterworks of the genre. Fitz's young daughter, Bee, has been kidnapped by the Servants, a secret society whose members not only dream of possible futures but use their prophecies to add to their wealth and influence. Bee plays a crucial part in these dreams - but just what part remains uncertain. As Bee is dragged by her sadistic captors across half the world, Fitz and the Fool, believing her dead, embark on a mission of revenge that will take them to the distant island where the Servants reside - a place the Fool once called home and later called prison. It was a hell the Fool escaped, maimed and blinded, swearing never to return. For all his injuries, however, the Fool is not as helpless as he seems. He is a dreamer, too, able to shape the future. And though Fitz is no longer the peerless assassin of his youth, he remains a man to be reckoned with - deadly with blades and poison and adept in Farseer magic. And their goal is simple: to make sure not a single Servant survives their scourge.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0iykh7/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature

Now in development for TV! Since its debut in 1990, The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan has captivated millions of readers and listeners around the globe with its scope, originality, and compelling characters. The Wheel of Time turns and ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow. The Seanchan invasion force is in possession of Ebou Dar. Nynaeve, Elayne, and Aviendha head for Caemlyn and Elayne's rightful throne, but on the way they discover an enemy much worse than the Seanchan. In Illian, Rand vows to throw the Seanchan back as he did once before. But signs of madness are appearing among the Asha'man. In Ghealdan, Perrin faces the intrigues of Whitecloaks, Seanchan invaders, the scattered Shaido Aiel, and the Prophet himself. Perrin's beloved wife, Faile, may pay with her life, and Perrin himself may have to destroy his soul to save her. Meanwhile the rebel Aes Sedai under their young Amyrlin, Egwene al'Vere, face an army that intends to keep them away from the White Tower. But Egwene is determined to unseat the usurper Elaida and reunite the Aes Sedai.

Prepare for ancient mysteries, innovative magic, and heart-pounding heists.\" (Brandon Sanderson)\"Complex characters, magic that is tech and vice versa, a world bound by warring trade dynasties: Bennett will leave you in awe once you remember to breathe!\" (Tamora Pierce)In a city that runs on industrialized magic, a secret war will be fought to overwrite reality itself - the first in a dazzling new fantasy series from City of Stairs author Robert Jackson Bennett.  Sancia Grado is a thief, and a damn good one. And her latest target, a heavily guarded warehouse on Tevanne’s docks, is nothing her unique abilities can’t handle.  But unbeknownst to her, Sancia’s been sent to steal an artifact of unimaginable power, an object that could revolutionize the magical technology known as scriving. The Merchant Houses who control this magic - the art of using coded commands to imbue everyday objects with sentience - have already used it to transform Tevanne into a vast, remorseless capitalist machine. But if they can unlock the artifact’s secrets, they will rewrite the world itself to suit their aims.  Now someone in those Houses wants Sancia dead, and the artifact for themselves. And in the city of Tevanne, there’s nobody with the power to stop them.  To have a chance at surviving - and at stopping the deadly transformation that’s under way - Sancia will have to marshal unlikely allies, learn to harness the artifact’s power for herself, and undergo her own transformation, one that will turn her into something she could never have imagined.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0mkmhn/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1636978363697,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Robert Jackson Bennett/Foundryside","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Robert Jackson Bennett/Foundryside","addedAt":1636978230216,"lastUpdate":1636978363697,"duration":70471886,"size":561440502,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":43,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":1344.343,"title":"Robert Jackson Bennett -

It’s been four weeks since the bloody showdown at Black Mesa, and Maggie Hoskie, Diné monster hunter, is trying to make the best of things. Only her latest bounty hunt has gone sideways, she’s lost her only friend, Kai Arviso, and she’s somehow found herself responsible for a girl with a strange clan power.  Then the Goodacre twins show up at Maggie’s door with the news that Kai and the youngest Goodacre, Caleb, have fallen in with a mysterious cult, led by a figure out of Navajo legend called the White Locust. The Goodacres are convinced that Kai’s a true believer, but Maggie suspects there’s more to Kai’s new faith than meets the eye. She vows to track down the White Locust, then rescue Kai and make things right between them.  Her search leads her beyond the Walls of Dinétah and straight into the horrors of the Big Water world outside. With the aid of a motley collection of allies, Maggie must battle body harvesters, newborn casino gods, and, ultimately, the White Locust himself. But the cult leader is nothing like she suspected, and Kai might not need rescuing after all. When the full scope of the White Locust’s plans are revealed, Maggie’s burgeoning trust in her friends and herself will be pushed to the breaking point, and not everyone will survive.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw0o0iy6/The Sixth World 1 -

Kuang's acclaimed, award-winning epic fantasy that combines the history of 20th-century China with a gripping world of gods and monsters, to devastating, enthralling effect. After saving her nation of Nikan from foreign invaders and battling the evil Empress Su Daji in a brutal civil war, Fang Runin was betrayed by allies and left for dead.  Despite her losses, Rin hasn't given up on those for whom she has sacrificed so much - the people of the southern provinces and especially Tikany, the village that is her home. Returning to her roots, Rin meets difficult challenges - and unexpected opportunities. While her new allies in the Southern Coalition leadership are sly and untrustworthy, Rin quickly realizes that the real power in Nikan lies with the millions of common people who thirst for vengeance and revere her as a goddess of salvation.  Backed by the masses and her Southern Army, Rin will use every weapon to defeat the Dragon Republic, the colonizing Hesperians, and all who threaten the shamanic arts and their practitioners. As her power and influence grows, though, will she be strong enough to resist the Phoenix's intoxicating voice urging her to burn the world and everything in it?","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw0pxmgo/R.

Far from the savage remnants of humanity, Henry and his family have managed to survive the grip of desolate, perpetual winter on a vast tundra that was once an ocean teeming with life. When the family is discovered, their peaceful existence is shattered and their lives changed forever.   Henry’s siblings are kidnapped, leaving him alone in the ruins of their home. Broken, altered, and tormented by all that has befallen him, he is driven to wreak vengeance upon those who assume him dead...by any means necessary.

How could she not be? Her sister, Ayoola, is many things: the favorite child, the beautiful one, possibly sociopathic. And now Ayoola's third boyfriend in a row is dead. Korede's practicality is the sisters' saving grace. She knows the best solutions for cleaning blood, the trunk of her car is big enough for a body, and she keeps Ayoola from posting pictures of her dinner to Instagram when she should be mourning her 'missing' boyfriend. Not that she gets any credit. A kind, handsome doctor at the hospital where Korede works is the bright spot in her life. She dreams of the day when he will realize they're perfect for each other. But one day Ayoola shows up to the hospital uninvited, and he takes notice. When he asks Korede for Ayoola's phone number, she must reckon with what her sister has become and what she will do about it. Sharp as nails and full of deadpan wit, Oyinkan Braithwaite has written a deliciously deadly debut that's as fun as it is frightening.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw0tpa5g/my sister the serial killer Cover.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Oyinkan Braithwaite/My Sister the Serial Killer/my sister the serial killer Cover.jpg","genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1636990206559,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Oyinkan Braithwaite/My Sister the Serial Killer","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Oyinkan Braithwaite/My Sister the Serial Killer","addedAt":1636990204687,"lastUpdate":1636990206559,"duration":15377058,"size":249309253,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":1,"chapters":[],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0txil6","ino":"14710882230330622420","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Bloody Rose","subtitle":null,"author":"Nicholas Eames","authorFL":"Nicholas Eames","authorLF":"Eames, Nicholas","narrator":"Katherine Fenton","series":"The Band","volumeNumber":"2","publishYear":"2018","publisher":null,"description":"A stand-alone epic fantasy adventure featuring a band of legendary mercenaries set in the world of Kings of the Wyld from author Nicholas Eames, who has been hailed as \"the voice of modern fantasy\" by Michael R.

It reads: Burn before reading.  Thus begins an unlikely correspondence between two rival agents hellbent on securing the best possible future for their warring factions. Now, what began as a taunt, a battlefield boast, becomes something more. Something epic. Something romantic. Something that could change the past and the future.  Except the discovery of their bond would mean the death of each of them. There’s still a war going on, after all. And someone has to win. That’s how war works, right?  Cowritten by two beloved and award-winning sci-fi writers, This Is How You Lose the Time War is an epic love story spanning time and space.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0yj23j/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Romance","Science Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1636998512446,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Max Gladstone/This Is How You Lose the Time War","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Max Gladstone/This Is How You Lose the Time War","addedAt":1636998312767,"lastUpdate":1636998512446,"duration":15359205,"size":188542605,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":28,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":36.595,"title":"001 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":1,"start":36.595,"end":43.91,"title":"002 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":2,"start":43.91,"end":733.972,"title":"003 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":3,"start":733.972,"end":1110.527,"title":"004 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":4,"start":1110.527,"end":1715.8220000000001,"title":"005 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":5,"start":1715.8220000000001,"end":2236.1310000000003,"title":"006 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":6,"start":2236.1310000000003,"end":2799.1910000000003,"title":"007 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":7,"start":2799.1910000000003,"end":3468.9030000000002,"title":"008 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":8,"start":3468.9030000000002,"end":4091.639,"title":"009 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":9,"start":4091.639,"end":4954.986,"title":"010 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":10,"start":4954.986,"end":5605.8679999999995,"title":"011 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":11,"start":5605.8679999999995,"end":6410.191999999999,"title":"012 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":12,"start":6410.191999999999,"end":7035.206999999999,"title":"013 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":13,"start":7035.206999999999,"end":7441.746999999999,"title":"014 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":14,"start":7441.746999999999,"end":8196.855,"title":"015 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":15,"start":8196.855,"end":8569.684,"title":"016 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":16,"start":8569.684,"end":9574.537999999999,"title":"017 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":17,"start":9574.537999999999,"end":9964.827,"title":"018 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":18,"start":9964.827,"end":10886.157,"title":"019 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":19,"start":10886.157,"end":11608.5,"title":"020 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":20,"start":11608.5,"end":11974.315,"title":"021 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":21,"start":11974.315,"end":12668.597,"title":"022 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":22,"start":12668.597,"end":13290.653,"title":"023 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":23,"start":13290.653,"end":13852.75,"title":"024 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":24,"start":13852.75,"end":14244.785,"title":"025 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":25,"start":14244.785,"end":14795.064,"title":"026 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":26,"start":14795.064,"end":15312.178,"title":"027 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"},{"id":27,"start":15312.178,"end":15359.205,"title":"028 Amal El-Mohtar Max Gladstone (2019) This Is How You Lose the Time War"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0zpmnc","ino":"7516929344333245814","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Caine's Law","subtitle":null,"author":"Matthew Stover","authorFL":"Matthew Stover","authorLF":"Stover, Matthew","narrator":"Stefan Rudnicki","series":"Acts of Caine","volumeNumber":"4","publishYear":"2012","publisher":null,"description":"Some laws you break. Some break you. And then there's Caine's Law. From the moment Caine first appeared in the pages of Heroes Die, two things were clear. First, that Matthew Stover was one of the most gifted fantasy writers of his generation. And second, that Caine was a hero whose peers go by such names as Conan and Elric. Like them, Caine was something new: a civilized man who embraced savagery, an actor whose life was a lie, a force of destruction so potent that even gods thought twice about crossing him. Now Stover brings back his greatest creation for his most stunning performance yet. Caine is washed up and hung out to dry, a crippled husk kept isolated and restrained by the studio that exploited him. Now they have dragged him back for one last deal. But Caine has other plans. Those plans take him back to Overworld, the alternate reality where gods are real and magic is the ultimate weapon. There, in a violent odyssey through time and space, Caine will face the demons of his past, find true love, and just possibly destroy the universe.

For fans of Westworld, Ex Machina, Ann Leckie's Imperial Raadch series, or Iain M. Banks' Culture novels. All Systems Red tackles questions of the ethics of sentient robotics. The main character is a deadly security droid that has bucked its restrictive programming and is balanced between contemplative self-discovery and an idle instinct to kill all humans. In a corporate-dominated spacefaring future, planetary missions must be approved and supplied by the Company. Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids, for their own safety. But in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn't a primary concern. On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied 'droid - a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as \"Murderbot.\" Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is. But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it's up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw10dedu/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Science Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637002040297,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Martha Wells/All Systems Red","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Martha Wells/All Systems Red","addedAt":1637001407765,"lastUpdate":1637002040297,"duration":11864163,"size":145215693,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":10,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":11.0,"title":"001 Martha Wells (2017) All Systems Red"},{"id":1,"start":11.0,"end":1335.06,"title":"002 Martha Wells (2017) All Systems Red"},{"id":2,"start":1335.06,"end":2478.54,"title":"003 Martha Wells (2017) All Systems Red"},{"id":3,"start":2478.54,"end":3682.3599999999997,"title":"004 Martha Wells (2017) All Systems Red"},{"id":4,"start":3682.3599999999997,"end":5824.94,"title":"005 Martha Wells (2017) All Systems Red"},{"id":5,"start":5824.94,"end":7861.389999999999,"title":"006 Martha Wells (2017) All Systems Red"},{"id":6,"start":7861.389999999999,"end":9637.16,"title":"007 Martha Wells (2017) All Systems Red"},{"id":7,"start":9637.16,"end":11062.5,"title":"008 Martha Wells (2017) All Systems Red"},{"id":8,"start":11062.5,"end":11831.803,"title":"009 Martha Wells (2017) All Systems Red"},{"id":9,"start":11831.803,"end":11864.163,"title":"010 Martha Wells (2017) All Systems Red"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw115c67","ino":"14520006915088612371","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Limited Wish","subtitle":null,"author":"Mark Lawrence","authorFL":"Mark Lawrence","authorLF":"Lawrence, Mark","narrator":"Matthew Frow","series":"Nick Hayes Series","volumeNumber":"2","publishYear":"2019","publisher":null,"description":"One choice.

returns with an unforgettable portrait of an artist as a young woman. Blindsided by her mother’s sudden death and wrecked by a recent love affair, Casey Peabody has arrived in Massachusetts in the summer of 1997 without a plan. Her mail consists of wedding invitations and final notices from debt collectors. A former child golf prodigy, she now waits tables in Harvard Square and rents a tiny, moldy room at the side of a garage where she works on the novel she has been writing for six years. At 31, Casey is still clutching onto something nearly all her old friends have let go of: the determination to live a creative life. When she falls for two very different men at the same time, her world fractures even more. Casey’s fight to fulfill her creative ambitions and balance the conflicting demands of art and life is challenged in ways that push her to the brink.  Writers & Lovers follows Casey - a smart and achingly vulnerable protagonist - in the last days of a long youth, a time when every element of her life comes to a crisis. Written with King’s trademark humor, heart, and intelligence, Writers & Lovers is a transfixing novel that explores the terrifying and exhilarating leap between the end of one phase of life and the beginning of another.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw12kljm/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637005127024,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Lily King/Writers & Lovers","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Lily King/Writers & Lovers","addedAt":1637005102707,"lastUpdate":1637005127024,"duration":29660310,"size":362248664,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":8,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":4546.217,"title":"Writers & Lovers-Part01"},{"id":1,"start":4546.217,"end":8694.589,"title":"Writers & Lovers-Part02"},{"id":2,"start":8694.589,"end":13017.773000000001,"title":"Writers & Lovers-Part03"},{"id":3,"start":13017.773000000001,"end":16931.372000000003,"title":"Writers & Lovers-Part04"},{"id":4,"start":16931.372000000003,"end":20743.052000000003,"title":"Writers & Lovers-Part05"},{"id":5,"start":20743.052000000003,"end":24149.562000000005,"title":"Writers & Lovers-Part06"},{"id":6,"start":24149.562000000005,"end":27686.240000000005,"title":"Writers & Lovers-Part07"},{"id":7,"start":27686.240000000005,"end":29660.310000000005,"title":"Writers & Lovers-Part08"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw12rshc","ino":"13682190301722442537","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Ruin and Rising","subtitle":null,"author":"Leigh Bardugo","authorFL":"Leigh Bardugo","authorLF":"Bardugo, Leigh","narrator":"Lauren Fortgang","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2014","publisher":null,"description":"The capital has fallen.

Mankind was nearly eradicated by the seemingly unstoppable beasts until the gods sent the great hero, Ramrowan, to save them. He united the tribes, gave them magic, and drove the demons into the sea. Ever since, the land has belonged to man, and the oceans have remained an uncrossable hell, leaving the continent of Lok isolated. It was prophesized that someday the demons would return, and only the descendants of Ramrowan would be able to defeat them. They became the first kings, and all men served those who were their only hope for survival. As centuries passed, the descendants of the great hero grew in number and power. They became tyrannical and cruel and their religion nothing but an excuse for greed. Gods and demons became myth and legend, and the people no longer believed. The castes created to serve the Sons of Ramrowan rose up and destroyed their rulers. All religion was banned and replaced by a code of unflinching law. The surviving royalty and their priests were made casteless, condemned to live as untouchables, and the Age of Law began. Ashok Vadal has been chosen by a powerful ancient weapon to be its bearer. He is a Protector, the elite militant order of roving law enforcers. No one is more merciless in rooting out those who secretly practice the old ways. Everything is black or white, good or evil, until he discovers his entire life is a fraud. Ashok isn’t who he thinks he is, and when he finds himself on the wrong side of the law, the consequences lead to rebellion, war - and destruction.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw12sp7m/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction &

the hospital with a scarred face, an unbelievable memory, and a job offer. It turns out that monsters are real. All the things from myth, legend, and B-movies are out there, waiting in the shadows. Officially secret, some of them are evil, and some are just hungry. On the other side are the people who kill monsters for a living. Monster Hunter International is the premier eradication company in the business. And now Owen is their newest recruit. It's actually a pretty sweet gig, except for one little problem. An ancient entity known as the Cursed One has returned to settle a centuries-old vendetta. Should the Cursed One succeed, it means the end of the world, and MHI is the only thing standing in his way. With the clock ticking towards Armageddon, Owen finds himself trapped between legions of undead minions, belligerent federal agents, a cryptic ghost who has taken up residence inside his head, and the cursed family of the woman he loves.

I loved it.\" (John Scalzi) Katherine Addison returns to the glittering world she created for her beloved novel, The Goblin Emperor, in this stand-alone sequel When the young half-goblin emperor Maia sought to learn who had set the bombs that killed his father and half-brothers, he turned to an obscure resident of his father’s Court, a Prelate of Ulis and a Witness for the Dead. Thara Celehar found the truth, though it did him no good to discover it. He lost his place as a retainer of his cousin the former Empress, and made far too many enemies among the many factions vying for power in the new Court. The favor of the Emperor is a dangerous coin. Now Celehar lives in the city of Amalo, far from the Court though not exactly in exile. He has not escaped from politics, but his position gives him the ability to serve the common people of the city, which is his preference. He lives modestly, but his decency and fundamental honesty will not permit him to live quietly. As a Witness for the Dead, he can, sometimes, speak to the recently dead: see the last thing they saw, know the last thought they had, experience the last thing they felt. It is his duty use that ability to resolve disputes, to ascertain the intent of the dead, to find the killers of the murdered. Celehar’s skills now lead him out of the quiet and into a morass of treachery, murder, and injustice. No matter his own background with the imperial house, Celehar will stand with the commoners, and possibly find a light in the darkness. Katherine Addison has created a fantastic world for these books - wide and deep and true.

Her dread weapon, the Exile Splinter, even erased the memory of its location from the universe. Now it's returning and bringing the Exile Splinter back with it. The great powers of the continent are desperately hunting for the site of the lost city, knowledge lost even to Kanderon herself. None know what ancient Ithonian weapons and enchantments might still be found in the ruins, but the Exile Splinter alone would be a prize to justify war. Hugh and his friends find themselves dragged along on the search, where they'll face enemy warlocks, sea monsters, liches, unnatural storms, and even a man-eating tiger. However, there's something they're not being told about the lost city...something that has even Kanderon and the other great powers terrified. Includes Murder at Ras Andis, a bonus novella from the Mage Errant series, and a special note from the author.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw163u7g/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637011043267,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"John Bierce/The Lost City of Ithos","fullPath":"/audiobooks/John Bierce/The Lost City of Ithos","addedAt":1637011039499,"lastUpdate":1637011043268,"duration":58048812,"size":354160843,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":1,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":19.825,"title":"Chapter 1"},{"id":1,"start":19.825,"end":990.883,"title":"Chapter 2"},{"id":2,"start":990.883,"end":1820.114,"title":"Chapter 3"},{"id":3,"start":1820.114,"end":3090.989,"title":"Chapter 4"},{"id":4,"start":3090.989,"end":4618.954,"title":"Chapter 5"},{"id":5,"start":4618.954,"end":6177.339,"title":"Chapter 6"},{"id":6,"start":6177.339,"end":6949.75,"title":"Chapter 7"},{"id":7,"start":6949.75,"end":8652.47,"title":"Chapter 8"},{"id":8,"start":8652.47,"end":10090.505,"title":"Chapter 9"},{"id":9,"start":10090.505,"end":11496.45,"title":"Chapter 10"},{"id":10,"start":11496.45,"end":12155.711,"title":"Chapter 11"},{"id":11,"start":12155.711,"end":13475.626,"title":"Chapter 12"},{"id":12,"start":13475.626,"end":14463.588,"title":"Chapter 13"},{"id":13,"start":14463.588,"end":15572.179,"title":"Chapter 14"},{"id":14,"start":15572.179,"end":16629.29,"title":"Chapter 15"},{"id":15,"start":16629.29,"end":17726.526,"title":"Chapter 16"},{"id":16,"start":17726.526,"end":18904.544,"title":"Chapter 17"},{"id":17,"start":18904.544,"end":19651.182,"title":"Chapter 18"},{"id":18,"start":19651.182,"end":21963.61,"title":"Chapter 19"},{"id":19,"start":21963.61,"end":23282.272,"title":"Chapter 20"},{"id":20,"start":23282.272,"end":24767.002,"title":"Chapter 21"},{"id":21,"start":24767.002,"end":27157.334,"title":"Chapter 22"},{"id":22,"start":27157.334,"end":28438.263,"title":"Chapter 23"},{"id":23,"start":28438.263,"end":29777.915,"title":"Chapter 24"},{"id":24,"start":29777.915,"end":30980.987,"title":"Chapter 25"},{"id":25,"start":30980.987,"end":32965.086,"title":"Chapter 26"},{"id":26,"start":32965.086,"end":34424.088,"title":"Chapter 27"},{"id":27,"start":34424.088,"end":35936.683,"title":"Chapter 28"},{"id":28,"start":35936.683,"end":36535.943,"title":"Chapter 29"},{"id":29,"start":36535.943,"end":37662.691,"title":"Chapter 30"},{"id":30,"start":37662.691,"end":38342.781,"title":"Chapter 31"},{"id":31,"start":38342.781,"end":39564.313,"title":"Chapter 32"},{"id":32,"start":39564.313,"end":40391.849,"title":"Chapter 33"},{"id":33,"start":40391.849,"end":41213.557,"title":"Chapter 34"},{"id":34,"start":41213.557,"end":41860.0,"title":"Chapter 35"},{"id":35,"start":41860.0,"end":43027.732,"title":"Chapter 36"},{"id":36,"start":43027.732,"end":44252.282,"title":"Chapter 37"},{"id":37,"start":44252.282,"end":46534.061,"title":"Chapter 38"},{"id":38,"start":46534.061,"end":47678.874,"title":"Chapter 39"},{"id":39,"start":47678.874,"end":49142.869,"title":"Chapter 40"},{"id":40,"start":49142.869,"end":49932.348,"title":"Chapter 41"},{"id":41,"start":49932.348,"end":51537.056,"title":"Chapter 42"},{"id":42,"start":51537.056,"end":52589.454,"title":"Chapter 43"},{"id":43,"start":52589.454,"end":53285.147,"title":"Chapter 44"},{"id":44,"start":53285.147,"end":53356.455,"title":"Chapter 45"},{"id":45,"start":53356.455,"end":57593.284,"title":"Chapter 46"},{"id":46,"start":57593.284,"end":58048.708,"title":"Chapter 47"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw163xpf","ino":"13247465124872601242","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Mage Errant","subtitle":"Publisher's Pack","author":"John Bierce","authorFL":"John Bierce","authorLF":"Bierce, John","narrator":"Ralph Lister","series":"Mage Errant","volumeNumber":"1","publishYear":"2018","publisher":null,"description":"Mage Errant: Publisher's Pack contains books one and two of the Mage Errant series. Into the Labyrinth, book one Hugh of Emblin is, so far as he's concerned, the worst student that the Academy at Skyhold has ever seen. He can barely cast any spells at all, and those he does cast tend to fail explosively. If that wasn't bad enough, he's also managed to attract the ire of the most promising student of his year - who also happens to be the nephew of a king. Hugh has no friends, no talent, and definitely doesn't expect a mage to choose him as an apprentice at all during the upcoming Choosing. When a very unusual mage does choose him as apprentice, however, his life starts to take a sharp turn for the better. Now all he has to worry about is the final test for the first years - being sent into the terrifying labyrinth below Skyhold. Jewel of the Endless Erg, book two After surviving Skyhold's deadly labyrinth, Hugh and his friends are looking forwards to an uneventful summer. Their teacher, Alustin, has chartered a sandship for a training expedition into the vast sea of sand known as the Endless Erg, aiming for the wealthy and powerful desert city of Theras Tel. Hugh's happier than he's been in a long, long time, and he's quite excited for the fresh air, sunshine, and quiet. Of course, given Hugh's luck, their summer is going to be anything but quiet. They're about to be plunged into a morass of pirates, monsters, warring cults, flesh-tearing sandstorms, and a conspiracy against Indris Stormbreaker, the dragon queen of Theras Tel herself. At least Hugh's going to get plenty of fresh air and sunshine.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw163xpf/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre

It turns out that surviving the depths of the labyrinth and helping stop a coup both tend to attract notice. If Hugh had his way, he'd happily go back to being just another anonymous student. He has more than enough to deal with already as he starts his second year, between his crushing load of schoolwork, training as a prospective candidate to the Librarians Errant, and navigating a long distance relationship. Oh, and the fact that Hugh and company have been dragged into trying to catch a traitor on the Skyhold Council doesn't make life any easier. Nor does it help that the traitor is working with the demon Bakori, who lurks in the depths of the labyrinth below Skyhold, waiting for his chance at revenge.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1693j4/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637011540123,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"John Bierce/A Traitor in Skyhold","fullPath":"/audiobooks/John Bierce/A Traitor in Skyhold","addedAt":1637011284590,"lastUpdate":1637011540123,"duration":42784713,"size":681985147,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":38,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":15.0,"title":"Chapter 0 (Opening Credits)"},{"id":1,"start":15.0,"end":968.0,"title":"Chapter 1 (Chapter One: Docks)"},{"id":2,"start":968.0,"end":2098.0,"title":"Chapter 2 (Chapter Two: Unwelcome Revelations)"},{"id":3,"start":2098.0,"end":2637.0,"title":"Chapter 3 (Chapter Three: Class)"},{"id":4,"start":2637.0,"end":4344.0,"title":"Chapter 4 (Chapter Four: Eccentric Faculty)"},{"id":5,"start":4344.0,"end":5370.0,"title":"Chapter 5 (Chapter Five: Intermediate Library Filing Skills)"},{"id":6,"start":5370.0,"end":6062.0,"title":"Chapter 6 (Chapter Six: Gifts)"},{"id":7,"start":6062.0,"end":7139.0,"title":"Chapter 7 (Chapter Seven: Silence and Sand)"},{"id":8,"start":7139.0,"end":8368.0,"title":"Chapter 8 (Chapter Eight: Fatigue)"},{"id":9,"start":8368.0,"end":9564.0,"title":"Chapter 9 (Chapter Nine: An Unpleasant Surprise)"},{"id":10,"start":9564.0,"end":10298.0,"title":"Chapter 10 (Chapter Ten: The Hidden Valley)"},{"id":11,"start":10298.0,"end":11707.0,"title":"Chapter 11 (Chapter Eleven: Motives)"},{"id":12,"start":11707.0,"end":12691.0,"title":"Chapter 12 (Chapter Twelve: The Owl Returns)"},{"id":13,"start":12691.0,"end":14252.0,"title":"Chapter 13 (Chapter Thirteen: Sand, Stone, and Crystal)"},{"id":14,"start":14252.0,"end":15243.0,"title":"Chapter 14 (Chapter Fourteen: Shield)"},{"id":15,"start":15243.0,"end":16145.0,"title":"Chapter 15 (Chapter Fifteen: Dragon Bones)"},{"id":16,"start":16145.0,"end":17173.0,"title":"Chapter 16 (Chapter Sixteen: Obsidian)"},{"id":17,"start":17173.0,"end":18308.0,"title":"Chapter 17 (Chapter Seventeen: Arrivals)"},{"id":18,"start":18308.0,"end":20835.0,"title":"Chapter 18 (Chapter Eighteen: Midwinter)"},{"id":19,"start":20835.0,"end":22418.0,"title":"Chapter 19 (Chapter Nineteen: Narrowing the Field)"},{"id":20,"start":22418.0,"end":23446.0,"title":"Chapter 20 (Chapter Twenty: Long Overdue Explanations)"},{"id":21,"start":23446.0,"end":24216.0,"title":"Chapter 21 (Chapter Twenty-One: Starfire)"},{"id":22,"start":24216.0,"end":25262.0,"title":"Chapter 22 (Chapter Twenty-Two: Thrones)"},{"id":23,"start":25262.0,"end":26199.0,"title":"Chapter 23 (Chapter Twenty-Three: Ilinia Kaen Das)"},{"id":24,"start":26199.0,"end":27545.0,"title":"Chapter 24 (Chapter Twenty-Four: Setting the Stage)"},{"id":25,"start":27545.0,"end":29085.0,"title":"Chapter 25 (Chapter Twenty-Five: Departures)"},{"id":26,"start":29085.0,"end":29879.0,"title":"Chapter 26 (Chapter Twenty-Six: Return to the Labyrinth)"},{"id":27,"start":29879.0,"end":31264.0,"title":"Chapter 27 (Chapter Twenty-Seven: Twists and Turns)"},{"id":28,"start":31264.0,"end":31840.0,"title":"Chapter 28 (Chapter Twenty-Eight: Imps)"},{"id":29,"start":31840.0,"end":32805.0,"title":"Chapter 29 (Chapter Twenty-Nine: Race to the Top)"},{"id":30,"start":32805.0,"end":34195.0,"title":"Chapter 30 (Chapter Thirty: Out of the Labyrinth)"},{"id":31,"start":34195.0,"end":35430.0,"title":"Chapter 31 (Chapter Thirty-One: Wreck the Halls)"},{"id":32,"start":35430.0,"end":36928.0,"title":"Chapter 32 (Chapter Thirty-Two: Confrontations)"},{"id":33,"start":36928.0,"end":38242.0,"title":"Chapter 33 (Chapter Thirty-Three: The Council Broken)"},{"id":34,"start":38242.0,"end":39460.0,"title":"Chapter 34 (Chapter Thirty-Four: Bakori Ascends)"},{"id":35,"start":39460.0,"end":41381.0,"title":"Chapter 35 (Chapter Thirty-Five: Don't Forget to Chew Your Food)"},{"id":36,"start":41381.0,"end":42712.0,"title":"Chapter 36 (Chapter Thirty-Six: Breathing Room)"},{"id":37,"start":42712.0,"end":42765.0,"title":"Chapter 37 (End Credits)"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw16z3m6","ino":"3246461950136411692","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Turn Coat","subtitle":null,"author":"Jim Butcher","authorFL":"Jim Butcher","authorLF":"Butcher, Jim","narrator":"James Marsters","series":"The Dresden Files","volumeNumber":"11","publishYear":"2009","publisher":null,"description":"The new novel in the hit New York Times best-selling Dresden Files series.

Avery Grambs has a plan for a better future: Survive high school, win a scholarship, and get out. But her fortunes change in an instant when billionaire Tobias Hawthorne dies and leaves Avery virtually his entire fortune. The catch? Avery has no idea why - or even who Tobias Hawthorne is.  To receive her inheritance, Avery must move into sprawling, secret passage-filled Hawthorne House, where every room bears the old man's touch - and his love of puzzles, riddles, and codes. Unfortunately for Avery, Hawthorne House is also occupied by the family that Tobias Hawthorne just dispossessed. This includes the four Hawthorne grandsons: Dangerous, magnetic, brilliant boys who grew up with every expectation that one day, they would inherit billions.  Heir apparent Grayson Hawthorne is convinced that Avery must be a con-woman, and he's determined to take her down. His brother, Jameson, views her as their grandfather's last hurrah: A twisted riddle, a puzzle to be solved. Caught in a world of wealth and privilege, with danger around every turn, Avery will have to play the game herself just to survive.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw1c1df7/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Jennifer Lynn Barnes/The Inheritance Games/cover.jpg","genres":["Teen & Young Adult","Literature

city of Pacta Servanda. Remnants of the Great Guilds and rebellious factions of the Empire want to seize those weapons to allow them to regain control of the world of Dematr. Only Jason, brought by the first ship from Earth since the colony failed, might be able to disarm the threat. But he also might know how to employ those weapons, making him a danger for all sides. Standing between those threats is Kira of Dematr. But Kira, who inexplicably has been able to manifest Mage powers as well as technical skills, finds herself being consumed by the mental conflicts between those powers and skills. As rogue Mechanics, Mages, and mercenaries attack with every weapon at their disposal, Kira suffers more blackouts and begins to lose her mind. The fate of her world rests on whether she can stay alive and find answers in time to problems that no one else has ever confronted.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw1cqqfn/Jack Campbell - [The Legacy of Dragons 3] - Destiny of Dragons  .jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Jack Campbell/Destiny of Dragons/Jack Campbell - [The Legacy of Dragons 3] - Destiny of Dragons  .jpg","genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637042151521,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Jack Campbell/Destiny of Dragons","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Jack Campbell/Destiny of Dragons","addedAt":1637022185123,"lastUpdate":1637042151521,"duration":51223069,"size":313508133,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":18,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":2515.003,"title":"Jack Campbell - [The Legacy of Dragons 3] - Destiny of Dragons   - 01"},{"id":1,"start":2515.003,"end":5375.1900000000005,"title":"Jack Campbell - [The Legacy of Dragons 3] - Destiny of Dragons   - 02"},{"id":2,"start":5375.1900000000005,"end":7850.019,"title":"Jack Campbell - [The Legacy of Dragons 3] - Destiny of Dragons   - 03"},{"id":3,"start":7850.019,"end":10889.419,"title":"Jack Campbell - [The Legacy of Dragons 3] - Destiny of Dragons   - 04"},{"id":4,"start":10889.419,"end":13864.499,"title":"Jack Campbell - [The Legacy of Dragons 3] - Destiny of Dragons   - 05"},{"id":5,"start":13864.499,"end":16842.553,"title":"Jack Campbell - [The Legacy of Dragons 3] - Destiny of Dragons   - 06"},{"id":6,"start":16842.553,"end":19606.61,"title":"Jack Campbell - [The Legacy of Dragons 3] - Destiny of Dragons   - 07"},{"id":7,"start":19606.61,"end":22613.177,"title":"Jack Campbell - [The Legacy of Dragons 3] - Destiny of Dragons   - 08"},{"id":8,"start":22613.177,"end":25710.719,"title":"Jack Campbell - [The Legacy of Dragons 3] - Destiny of Dragons   - 09"},{"id":9,"start":25710.719,"end":28697.641,"title":"Jack Campbell - [The Legacy of Dragons 3] - Destiny of Dragons   - 10"},{"id":10,"start":28697.641,"end":31520.769,"title":"Jack Campbell - [The Legacy of Dragons 3] - Destiny of Dragons   - 11"},{"id":11,"start":31520.769,"end":34431.949,"title":"Jack Campbell - [The Legacy of Dragons 3] - Destiny of Dragons   - 12"},{"id":12,"start":34431.949,"end":37110.371,"title":"Jack Campbell - [The Legacy of Dragons 3] - Destiny of Dragons   - 13"},{"id":13,"start":37110.371,"end":39498.962,"title":"Jack Campbell - [The Legacy of Dragons 3] - Destiny of Dragons   - 14"},{"id":14,"start":39498.962,"end":42352.138,"title":"Jack Campbell - [The Legacy of Dragons 3] - Destiny of Dragons   - 15"},{"id":15,"start":42352.138,"end":45414.154,"title":"Jack Campbell - [The Legacy of Dragons 3] - Destiny of Dragons   - 16"},{"id":16,"start":45414.154,"end":48540.769,"title":"Jack Campbell - [The Legacy of Dragons 3] - Destiny of Dragons   - 17"},{"id":17,"start":48540.769,"end":51223.069,"title":"Jack Campbell - [The Legacy of Dragons 3] - Destiny of Dragons   - 18"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1dqa9a","ino":"3512622039004709978","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"The Return of the King (Phil Dragash)","subtitle":null,"author":"J.R.R.

The Fellowship of the Ring, the first volume in the trilogy, tells of the fateful power of the One Ring. It begins a magnificent tale of adventure that will plunge the members of the Fellowship of the Ring into a perilous quest and set the stage for the ultimate clash between the powers of good and evil.

To do so, she has bound the wicked King Cardan to her and made herself the power behind the throne.

I hate him so much that sometimes when I look at him, I can hardly breathe. Jude was seven years old when her parents were murdered and she and her two sisters were stolen away to live in the treacherous High Court of Faerie. Ten years later, Jude wants nothing more than to belong there, despite her mortality. But many of the fey despise humans. Especially Prince Cardan, the youngest and wickedest son of the High King. To win a place at the Court, she must defy him - and face the consequences. In doing so, she becomes embroiled in palace intrigues and deceptions, discovering her own capacity for bloodshed. But as civil war threatens to drown the Courts of Faerie in violence, Jude will need to risk her life in a dangerous alliance to save her sisters, and Faerie itself.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1fy8b6/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Teen & Young Adult","Literature & Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637027679239,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Holly Black/The Cruel Prince","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Holly Black/The Cruel Prince","addedAt":1637027573632,"lastUpdate":1637027679239,"duration":45410753,"size":349215674,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":32,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":937.19625,"title":"Chapter 01"},{"id":1,"start":937.19625,"end":948.508344,"title":"Chapter 02"},{"id":2,"start":948.508344,"end":1756.920907,"title":"Chapter 03"},{"id":3,"start":1756.920907,"end":2716.504095,"title":"Chapter 04"},{"id":4,"start":2716.504095,"end":3690.950908,"title":"Chapter 05"},{"id":5,"start":3690.950908,"end":5097.593658,"title":"Chapter 06"},{"id":6,"start":5097.593658,"end":5357.6437209999995,"title":"Chapter 07"},{"id":7,"start":5357.6437209999995,"end":6125.409720999999,"title":"Chapter 08"},{"id":8,"start":6125.409720999999,"end":7652.790470999999,"title":"Chapter 09"},{"id":9,"start":7652.790470999999,"end":9076.334471,"title":"Chapter 10"},{"id":10,"start":9076.334471,"end":10260.962596,"title":"Chapter 11"},{"id":11,"start":10260.962596,"end":12247.210221,"title":"Chapter 12"},{"id":12,"start":12247.210221,"end":14107.208095999998,"title":"Chapter 13"},{"id":13,"start":14107.208095999998,"end":15112.583908999999,"title":"Chapter 14"},{"id":14,"start":15112.583908999999,"end":16667.027534,"title":"Chapter 15"},{"id":15,"start":16667.027534,"end":17801.213159,"title":"Chapter 16"},{"id":16,"start":17801.213159,"end":20211.323658999998,"title":"Chapter 17"},{"id":17,"start":20211.323658999998,"end":23209.372159,"title":"Chapter 18"},{"id":18,"start":23209.372159,"end":25723.162658999998,"title":"Chapter 19"},{"id":19,"start":25723.162658999998,"end":27179.307408999997,"title":"Chapter 20"},{"id":20,"start":27179.307408999997,"end":30185.166659,"title":"Chapter 21"},{"id":21,"start":30185.166659,"end":31224.214283999998,"title":"Chapter 22"},{"id":22,"start":31224.214283999998,"end":32964.257909,"title":"Chapter 23"},{"id":23,"start":32964.257909,"end":35527.681159,"title":"Chapter 24"},{"id":24,"start":35527.681159,"end":36567.407972,"title":"Chapter 25"},{"id":25,"start":36567.407972,"end":37783.957722,"title":"Chapter 26"},{"id":26,"start":37783.957722,"end":39324.739222,"title":"Chapter 27"},{"id":27,"start":39324.739222,"end":41052.113472,"title":"Chapter 28"},{"id":28,"start":41052.113472,"end":41808.046035,"title":"Chapter 29"},{"id":29,"start":41808.046035,"end":43354.992535,"title":"Chapter 30"},{"id":30,"start":43354.992535,"end":44736.871159999995,"title":"Chapter 31"},{"id":31,"start":44736.871159999995,"end":45410.753097999994,"title":"Chapter 32"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1g0i1c","ino":"9413811713209167984","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"How the King of Elfhame Learned to Hate Stories","subtitle":null,"author":"Holly Black","authorFL":"Holly Black","authorLF":"Black, Holly","narrator":"Caitlin Kelly","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2020","publisher":null,"description":"Return to the captivating world of Elfhame with this addition to the New York Times best-selling Folk of Air trilogy that began with The Cruel Prince, from award-winning author Holly Black.

A tiny community nestled deep in the forest, it is slowly losing ground to the ever encroaching trees. But down by the lake stands an old ice rink, built generations ago by the working men who founded this town. And in that ice rink is the reason people in Beartown believe tomorrow will be better than today. Their junior ice hockey team is about to compete in the national semifinals, and they actually have a shot at winning. All the hopes and dreams of this place now rest on the shoulders of a handful of teenage boys.  Being responsible for the hopes of an entire town is a heavy burden, and the semifinal match is the catalyst for a violent act that will leave a young girl traumatized and a town in turmoil. Accusations are made, and, like ripples on a pond, they travel through all of Beartown, leaving no resident unaffected.  Beartown explores the hopes that bring a small community together, the secrets that tear it apart, and the courage it takes for an individual to go against the grain. In this story of a small forest town, Fredrik Backman has found the entire world.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1jnaam/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637041186482,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Fredrik Backman/Beartown","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Fredrik Backman/Beartown","addedAt":1637033781365,"lastUpdate":1637041186482,"duration":47490331,"size":770446899,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":12,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":2771.357,"title":"Fredrik Backman - Beartown [01-12]"},{"id":1,"start":2771.357,"end":6869.16,"title":"Fredrik Backman - Beartown [02-12]"},{"id":2,"start":6869.16,"end":11199.165,"title":"Fredrik Backman - Beartown [03-12]"},{"id":3,"start":11199.165,"end":15017.876,"title":"Fredrik Backman - Beartown [04-12]"},{"id":4,"start":15017.876,"end":18577.922,"title":"Fredrik Backman - Beartown [05-12]"},{"id":5,"start":18577.922,"end":22789.593,"title":"Fredrik Backman - Beartown [06-12]"},{"id":6,"start":22789.593,"end":26676.927,"title":"Fredrik Backman - Beartown [07-12]"},{"id":7,"start":26676.927,"end":30322.079999999998,"title":"Fredrik Backman - Beartown [08-12]"},{"id":8,"start":30322.079999999998,"end":34360.167,"title":"Fredrik Backman - Beartown [09-12]"},{"id":9,"start":34360.167,"end":39023.051,"title":"Fredrik Backman - Beartown [10-12]"},{"id":10,"start":39023.051,"end":43185.011,"title":"Fredrik Backman - Beartown [11-12]"},{"id":11,"start":43185.011,"end":47490.331,"title":"Fredrik Backman - Beartown [12-12]"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1kizs1","ino":"396847150104363958","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Ready Player One","subtitle":null,"author":"Ernest Cline","authorFL":"Ernest Cline","authorLF":"Cline, Ernest","narrator":"Wil Wheaton","series":"Ready Player One","volumeNumber":"1","publishYear":"2011","publisher":null,"description":"At once wildly original and stuffed with irresistible nostalgia, Ready Player One is a spectacularly genre-busting, ambitious, and charming debut - part quest novel, part love story, and part virtual space opera set in a universe where spell-slinging mages battle giant Japanese robots, entire planets are inspired by Blade Runner, and flying DeLoreans achieve light speed. It’s the year 2044, and the real world is an ugly place. Like most of humanity, Wade Watts escapes his grim surroundings by spending his waking hours jacked into the OASIS, a sprawling virtual utopia that lets you be anything you want to be, a place where you can live and play and fall in love on any of 10,000 planets. And like most of humanity, Wade dreams of being the one to discover the ultimate lottery ticket that lies concealed within this virtual world. For somewhere inside this giant networked playground, OASIS creator James Halliday has hidden a series of fiendish puzzles that will yield massive fortune - and remarkable power - to whoever can unlock them. For years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that Halliday’s riddles are based in the pop culture he loved - that of the late 20th century. And for years, millions have found in this quest another means of escape, retreating into happy, obsessive study of Halliday’s icons. Like many of his contemporaries, Wade is as comfortable debating the finer points of John Hughes’s oeuvre, playing Pac-Man, or reciting Devo lyrics as he is scrounging power to run his OASIS rig. And then Wade stumbles upon the first puzzle. Suddenly the whole world is watching, and thousands of competitors join the hunt - among them certain powerful players who are willing to commit very real murder to beat Wade to this prize. Now the only way for Wade to survive and preserve everything he knows is to win. But to do so, he may have to leave behind his oh-so-perfect virtual existence and face up to life - and love - in the real world he’s always been so desperate to escape.

No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of breathtaking amazements. It is called Le Cirque des Rêves, and it is only open at night. But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway: a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands. True love or not, the game must play out, and the fates of everyone involved, from the cast of extraordinary circus per­formers to the patrons, hang in the balance, suspended as precariously as the daring acrobats overhead. Written in rich, seductive prose, this spell-casting novel is a feast for the senses and the heart.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1km91s/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre

A great read!\" (Mark Lawrence, Gemmell Award winner and international best-selling author of Prince of Thorns and Red Sister) Even myths have legends. And not all legends are myth. When a local hospital is attacked by strange and frightening men, Fiona Patterson and Zeke Prisco save a catatonic old man named Peter - and find themselves running for their lives with creatures beyond imagination hounding their every step.  With nowhere else to turn, they seek out Fi's enigmatic Uncle Edgar. But the more their questions are answered, the more they discover that nothing is what it seems - not Peter, not Edgar, perhaps not even themselves.  The gods and monsters, heroes and villains of lore - they're real. And now they've come out of hiding to hunt their own. In order to survive, Fi and Zeke must join up with powerful allies against an ancient evil that's been known by many names and feared by all. The final battle of the world's oldest war has begun.  \"Terrific. Paternus is intelligent, intricate, suspenseful, and epic.\" (Nicholas Eames, author of Kings of the Wyld and Bloody Rose) \"Ashton is a bloody, terrific genius. The action sequences are truly mind-boggling. Miss out on this one at your own risk.\" (Fantasy Book Critic)","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1m5gzb/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637038096247,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Dyrk Ashton/Rise of Gods","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Dyrk Ashton/Rise of Gods","addedAt":1637037989115,"lastUpdate":1637038096247,"duration":54031420,"size":434201106,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":40,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":24.01,"title":"Opening Credits"},{"id":1,"start":24.01,"end":36.410000000000004,"title":"Chapter 1"},{"id":2,"start":36.410000000000004,"end":163.981,"title":"Chapter 2"},{"id":3,"start":163.981,"end":1307.936,"title":"Chapter 3"},{"id":4,"start":1307.936,"end":3139.898,"title":"Chapter 4"},{"id":5,"start":3139.898,"end":4602.245,"title":"Chapter 5"},{"id":6,"start":4602.245,"end":5395.439,"title":"Chapter 6"},{"id":7,"start":5395.439,"end":6409.316000000001,"title":"Chapter 7"},{"id":8,"start":6409.316000000001,"end":7782.452000000001,"title":"Chapter 8"},{"id":9,"start":7782.452000000001,"end":8893.063000000002,"title":"Chapter 9"},{"id":10,"start":8893.063000000002,"end":10781.682000000003,"title":"Chapter 10"},{"id":11,"start":10781.682000000003,"end":12829.125000000002,"title":"Chapter 11"},{"id":12,"start":12829.125000000002,"end":14110.310000000001,"title":"Chapter 12"},{"id":13,"start":14110.310000000001,"end":15378.724000000002,"title":"Chapter 13"},{"id":14,"start":15378.724000000002,"end":17361.662000000004,"title":"Chapter 14"},{"id":15,"start":17361.662000000004,"end":18818.808000000005,"title":"Chapter 15"},{"id":16,"start":18818.808000000005,"end":21925.081000000006,"title":"Chapter 16"},{"id":17,"start":21925.081000000006,"end":22115.160000000007,"title":"Chapter 17"},{"id":18,"start":22115.160000000007,"end":22538.600000000006,"title":"Chapter 18"},{"id":19,"start":22538.600000000006,"end":23654.552000000007,"title":"Chapter 19"},{"id":20,"start":23654.552000000007,"end":23914.616000000005,"title":"Chapter 20"},{"id":21,"start":23914.616000000005,"end":25433.805000000004,"title":"Chapter 21"},{"id":22,"start":25433.805000000004,"end":26079.645000000004,"title":"Chapter 22"},{"id":23,"start":26079.645000000004,"end":27434.065000000002,"title":"Chapter 23"},{"id":24,"start":27434.065000000002,"end":28341.548000000003,"title":"Chapter 24"},{"id":25,"start":28341.548000000003,"end":29113.148,"title":"Chapter 25"},{"id":26,"start":29113.148,"end":30251.391,"title":"Chapter 26"},{"id":27,"start":30251.391,"end":32447.86,"title":"Chapter 27"},{"id":28,"start":32447.86,"end":36048.022,"title":"Chapter 28"},{"id":29,"start":36048.022,"end":38410.839,"title":"Chapter 29"},{"id":30,"start":38410.839,"end":42564.982,"title":"Chapter 30"},{"id":31,"start":42564.982,"end":45002.474,"title":"Chapter 31"},{"id":32,"start":45002.474,"end":46642.825000000004,"title":"Chapter 32"},{"id":33,"start":46642.825000000004,"end":49120.72,"title":"Chapter 33"},{"id":34,"start":49120.72,"end":52533.497,"title":"Chapter 34"},{"id":35,"start":52533.497,"end":52665.898,"title":"Chapter 35"},{"id":36,"start":52665.898,"end":53403.736000000004,"title":"Chapter 36"},{"id":37,"start":53403.736000000004,"end":53799.73,"title":"Chapter 37"},{"id":38,"start":53799.73,"end":54016.744000000006,"title":"Chapter 38"},{"id":39,"start":54016.744000000006,"end":54031.420000000006,"title":"End Credits"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1ngtni","ino":"12493363978686730644","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"The Fall of Hyperion","subtitle":null,"author":"Dan Simmons","authorFL":"Dan Simmons","authorLF":"Simmons, Dan","narrator":"Victor Bevine","series":"Hyperion","volumeNumber":"2","publishYear":"1990","publisher":null,"description":"In the stunning continuation of the epic adventure begun in Hyperion, Simmons returns us to a far future resplendent with drama and invention.

Frey is the captain of the Ketty Jay, leader of a small and highly dysfunctional band of layabouts. An inveterate womaniser and rogue, he and his gang make a living on the wrong side of the law, avoiding the heavily armed flying frigates of the Coalition Navy. With their trio of ragged fighter craft, they run contraband, rob airships, and generally make a nuisance of themselves. So a hot tip on a cargo freighter loaded with valuables seems like a great prospect for an easy heist and a fast buck. Until the heist goes wrong, and the freighter explodes. Suddenly Frey isn't just a nuisance anymore - he's public enemy number one, with the Coalition Navy on his tail and contractors hired to take him down. But Frey knows something they don't. That freighter was rigged to blow, and Frey has been framed to take the fall. If he wants to prove it, he's going to have to catch the real culprit. He must face liars and lovers, dogfights and gunfights, Dukes and daemons. It's going to take all his criminal talents to prove he's not the criminal they think he is. Rupert Degas has narrated over 100 audiobooks. He has recorded a diverse range of authors, from Andy McNab, James Patterson, Wilbur Smith, and Chris Ryan to children's authors such as Derek Landy, Darren Shan, Jamie Rix, and Philip Pullman. He has narrated books by Patrick Rothfuss, Haruki Murakami, Mervyn Peake, Rose Tremain, and Cormac McCarthy as well as recording classics from Kafka, Conan Doyle, Lovecraft, and Wilde.

Lydia is dead. But they don't know this yet.… So begins the story in this exquisite debut novel about a Chinese American family living in a small town in 1970s Ohio. Lydia is the favorite child of Marilyn and James Lee; their middle daughter, a girl who inherited her mother's bright blue eyes and her father's jet-black hair. Her parents are determined that Lydia will fulfill the dreams they were unable to pursue - in Marilyn's case that her daughter become a doctor rather than a homemaker, in James' case that Lydia be popular at school, a girl with a busy social life and the center of every party. When Lydia's body is found in the local lake, the delicate balancing act that has been keeping the Lee family together tumbles into chaos, forcing them to confront the long-kept secrets that have been slowly pulling them apart. James, consumed by guilt, sets out on a reckless path that may destroy his marriage. Marilyn, devastated and vengeful, is determined to find a responsible party, no matter what the cost. Lydia's older brother, Nathan, is certain the neighborhood bad boy Jack is somehow involved. But it's the youngest of the family, Hannah, who observes far more than anyone realizes - and who may be the only one who knows the truth about what happened. A profoundly moving story of family, history, and the meaning of home, Everything I Never Told You is both a gripping pause-resister and a sensitive family portrait, exploring the divisions between cultures and the rifts within a family and uncovering the ways in which mothers and daughters, fathers and sons, and husbands and wives struggle, all their lives, to understand one another.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1pnrr6/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637043910081,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Celest Ng/Everything I Never Told You","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Celest Ng/Everything I Never Told You","addedAt":1637043882034,"lastUpdate":1637043910081,"duration":36124035,"size":586277662,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":11,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":2957.192,"title":"Everything I Never Told You-Part01"},{"id":1,"start":2957.192,"end":6901.029,"title":"Everything I Never Told You-Part02"},{"id":2,"start":6901.029,"end":9372.84,"title":"Everything I Never Told You-Part03"},{"id":3,"start":9372.84,"end":12527.649000000001,"title":"Everything I Never Told You-Part04"},{"id":4,"start":12527.649000000001,"end":15186.889000000001,"title":"Everything I Never Told You-Part05"},{"id":5,"start":15186.889000000001,"end":19457.57,"title":"Everything I Never Told You-Part06"},{"id":6,"start":19457.57,"end":23935.246,"title":"Everything I Never Told You-Part07"},{"id":7,"start":23935.246,"end":26742.077999999998,"title":"Everything I Never Told You-Part08"},{"id":8,"start":26742.077999999998,"end":31217.193999999996,"title":"Everything I Never Told You-Part09"},{"id":9,"start":31217.193999999996,"end":34093.954999999994,"title":"Everything I Never Told You-Part10"},{"id":10,"start":34093.954999999994,"end":36124.034999999996,"title":"Everything I Never Told You-Part11"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1qh7it","ino":"341023596802832440","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"The Empires Ruin","subtitle":null,"author":"Brian Staveley","authorFL":"Brian Staveley","authorLF":"Staveley, Brian","narrator":"Moira Quirk; Joe Jameson; Oliver Cudbill","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2021","publisher":null,"description":"Brian Staveley, author of The Emperor's Blades, gives listeners the first book in a new epic fantasy trilogy based in the world of his popular series the Chronicle of the Unhewn Throne, The Empire's Ruin.

The ranks of the Kettral have been decimated from within, and the kenta gates, granting instantaneous travel across the vast lands of the empire, can no longer be used. In order to save the empire, one of the surviving Kettral must voyage beyond the edge of the known world through a land that warps and poisons all living things to find the nesting ground of the giant war hawks. Meanwhile, a monk turned con-artist may hold the secret to the kenta gates. But time is running out. Deep within the southern reaches of the empire and ancient god-like race has begun to stir. What they discover will change them and the Annurian Empire forever.

Pyrre Lakatur is not, to her mind, an assassin, not a murderer - she is a priestess. At least, she will be once she passes her final trial. The problem isn't the killing. The problem, rather, is love. For to complete her trial, Pyrre has ten days to kill the seven people enumerated in an ancient song, including \"the one who made your mind and body sing with love / who will not come again.\" Pyrre isn't sure she's ever been in love. And if she fails to find someone who can draw such passion from her, or fails to kill that someone, her order will give her to their god, the God of Death. Pyrre's not afraid to die, but she hates to fail, and so, as her trial is set to begin, she returns to the city of her birth in the hope of finding love... and ending it on the edge of her sword.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1qu5h1/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637045955840,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Brian Staveley/Skullsworn","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Brian Staveley/Skullsworn","addedAt":1637045858784,"lastUpdate":1637045955841,"duration":55280451,"size":651705653,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":29,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":23.475,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 01-29"},{"id":1,"start":23.475,"end":29.294,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 02-29"},{"id":2,"start":29.294,"end":2464.44,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 03-29"},{"id":3,"start":2464.44,"end":4566.821,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 04-29"},{"id":4,"start":4566.821,"end":8088.359,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 05-29"},{"id":5,"start":8088.359,"end":10463.714,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 06-29"},{"id":6,"start":10463.714,"end":11359.958,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 07-29"},{"id":7,"start":11359.958,"end":13332.261,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 08-29"},{"id":8,"start":13332.261,"end":14706.512,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 09-29"},{"id":9,"start":14706.512,"end":15647.756000000001,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 10-29"},{"id":10,"start":15647.756000000001,"end":19616.325,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 11-29"},{"id":11,"start":19616.325,"end":22622.798000000003,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 12-29"},{"id":12,"start":22622.798000000003,"end":24376.137000000002,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 13-29"},{"id":13,"start":24376.137000000002,"end":26064.460000000003,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 14-29"},{"id":14,"start":26064.460000000003,"end":28123.838000000003,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 15-29"},{"id":15,"start":28123.838000000003,"end":30637.212000000003,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 16-29"},{"id":16,"start":30637.212000000003,"end":31949.465000000004,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 17-29"},{"id":17,"start":31949.465000000004,"end":33339.69,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 18-29"},{"id":18,"start":33339.69,"end":35014.963,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 19-29"},{"id":19,"start":35014.963,"end":36095.202000000005,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 20-29"},{"id":20,"start":36095.202000000005,"end":37781.482,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 21-29"},{"id":21,"start":37781.482,"end":40383.882000000005,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 22-29"},{"id":22,"start":40383.882000000005,"end":42988.279,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 23-29"},{"id":23,"start":42988.279,"end":45946.687000000005,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 24-29"},{"id":24,"start":45946.687000000005,"end":47398.027,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 25-29"},{"id":25,"start":47398.027,"end":49401.352,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 26-29"},{"id":26,"start":49401.352,"end":54796.044,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 27-29"},{"id":27,"start":54796.044,"end":55221.5,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 28-29"},{"id":28,"start":55221.5,"end":55280.451,"title":"Brian Staveley - Skullsworn 29-29"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1qwala","ino":"11038996293267712155","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"The Sable Quean","subtitle":null,"author":"Brian Jacques","authorFL":"Brian Jacques","authorLF":"Jacques, Brian","narrator":"Brian Jacques","series":"Redwall","volumeNumber":"20","publishYear":"2009","publisher":null,"description":"With more than 20 million books sold, Brian Jacques’ acclaimed Redwall series has become the stuff of legend.

Warbreaker is the story of two sisters who happen to be princesses, the God King one of them has to marry, the lesser god who doesn't like his job, and the immortal who's still trying to undo the mistakes he made hundreds of years ago. Their world is one in which those who die in glory return as gods to live confined to a pantheon in Hallandren's capital city and where a power known as BioChromatic magic is based on an essence known as breath that can be collected only one unit at a time from individual people. By using breath and drawing upon the color in everyday objects, all manner of miracles and mischief can be accomplished. It will take considerable quantities of each to resolve all the challenges facing Vivenna and Siri, princesses of Idris; Susebron, the God King; Lightsong, reluctant god of bravery; and mysterious Vasher, the Warbreaker.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1sobxu/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637049544497,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Brandon Sanderson/Warbreaker","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Brandon Sanderson/Warbreaker","addedAt":1637048946315,"lastUpdate":1637049544497,"duration":89814573,"size":799259523,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":66,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":11.826,"title":"BSW01-66 Brandon Sanderson -

From number one New York Times best-selling author Brandon Sanderson comes a special gift edition of Edgedancer, a short audiobook from the Stormlight Archive (previously published in Arcanum Unbounded). Three years ago, Lift asked a goddess to stop her from growing older - a wish she believed was granted. Now, in Edgedancer, the barely teenage nascent Knight Radiant finds that time stands still for no one. Although the young Azish emperor granted her safe haven from an executioner she knows only as Darkness, court life is suffocating the free-spirited Lift, who can't help heading to Yeddaw when she hears the relentless Darkness is there hunting people like her with budding powers. The downtrodden in Yeddaw have no champion, and Lift knows she must seize this awesome responsibility.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw1trn1w/Edgedancer.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Brandon Sanderson/The Stormlight Archive 02.5 - Edgedancer/Edgedancer.jpg","genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637050829607,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Brandon Sanderson/The Stormlight Archive 02.5 - Edgedancer","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Brandon Sanderson/The Stormlight Archive 02.5 - Edgedancer","addedAt":1637050780819,"lastUpdate":1637050829607,"duration":18392537,"size":148540487,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":24,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":44.954,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - Edgedancer 01-24"},{"id":1,"start":44.954,"end":1059.156,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - Edgedancer 02-24"},{"id":2,"start":1059.156,"end":2055.153,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - Edgedancer 03-24"},{"id":3,"start":2055.153,"end":2953.9519999999998,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - Edgedancer 04-24"},{"id":4,"start":2953.9519999999998,"end":3709.808,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - Edgedancer 05-24"},{"id":5,"start":3709.808,"end":3913.122,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - Edgedancer 06-24"},{"id":6,"start":3913.122,"end":5025.032999999999,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - Edgedancer 07-24"},{"id":7,"start":5025.032999999999,"end":6007.052,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - Edgedancer 08-24"},{"id":8,"start":6007.052,"end":7669.973,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - Edgedancer 09-24"},{"id":9,"start":7669.973,"end":8499.437,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - Edgedancer 10-24"},{"id":10,"start":8499.437,"end":9458.607,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - Edgedancer 11-24"},{"id":11,"start":9458.607,"end":9891.567,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - Edgedancer 12-24"},{"id":12,"start":9891.567,"end":10406.678999999998,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - Edgedancer 13-24"},{"id":13,"start":10406.678999999998,"end":11177.163999999999,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - Edgedancer 14-24"},{"id":14,"start":11177.163999999999,"end":12466.475999999999,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - Edgedancer 15-24"},{"id":15,"start":12466.475999999999,"end":13402.612,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - Edgedancer 16-24"},{"id":16,"start":13402.612,"end":13830.696,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - Edgedancer 17-24"},{"id":17,"start":13830.696,"end":14637.543,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - Edgedancer 18-24"},{"id":18,"start":14637.543,"end":15952.907,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - Edgedancer 19-24"},{"id":19,"start":15952.907,"end":17293.86,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - Edgedancer 20-24"},{"id":20,"start":17293.86,"end":18224.238,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - Edgedancer 21-24"},{"id":21,"start":18224.238,"end":18347.397,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - Edgedancer 22-24"},{"id":22,"start":18347.397,"end":18388.218,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - Edgedancer 23-24"},{"id":23,"start":18388.218,"end":18392.537,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - Edgedancer 24-24"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1ty0jc","ino":"7202735314350568319","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"The Stormlight Archive 01","subtitle":"The Way of Kings","author":"Brandon Sanderson","authorFL":"Brandon Sanderson","authorLF":"Sanderson, Brandon","narrator":"Kate Reading; Michael Kramer","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2010","publisher":null,"description":"Speak again the ancient oaths,\nLife before death.\nStrength before weakness.\nJourney before Destination.\nand return to men the Shards they once bore.\nThe Knights Radiant must stand again.\n\nRoshar is a world of stone swept by tempests that shape ecology and civilization.

Injectable nanite technology is the lifeblood that flows through every individual wishing to experience the world through the lens of their own theme. While death from mortal wounds is still possible, life is made easier in a socially liberated society where automation and income equality allow passion pursuits to flourish over traditional work. Renewal stations are provided to every law-abiding citizen for weekly check-ins, which issue life-sustaining repairs in exchange for personal privacy. But what becomes of those who check out, of those who dare to resist immortality and risk being edited under the gaze of an identity-extracting government surveillance system?  When Holly Winseed wakes up in a hospital room, her memory compromised and a new identity imposed on her, a team of government agents wastes no time stating their objective. With intent to infiltrate and defeat the terrorist group ICON, the agents tell Holly that she is now a Provisional Replica and has one week to hunt down and kill her Original for the murder of her husband, Jonathan. If she succeeds, she’ll assume her Original’s place in society. If she fails, her life will end. Holly’s progress is monitored by an assigned contact that feeds her information as she confronts the blank, robotic world around her, discovering that others view life through the theme of their own choosing.  With her newly implanted combat and deduction skills, Holly fends off both attacks by terrorists and doubts about her own trustworthiness as clues lead her to her Original - and to the truth about Jonathan. In the end, one body remains and one walks away. Although questions persist, one thing is certain: Life will never be the same.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw1u31ct/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Brandon Sanderson/The Original/cover.jpg","genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Science Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637051338648,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Brandon Sanderson/The Original","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Brandon Sanderson/The Original","addedAt":1637051312556,"lastUpdate":1637051338648,"duration":12267052,"size":149903005,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":6,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":2216.072,"title":"001 Brandon Sanderson Mary Robinette Kowal (2020) The Original"},{"id":1,"start":2216.072,"end":4928.105,"title":"002 Brandon Sanderson Mary Robinette Kowal (2020) The Original"},{"id":2,"start":4928.105,"end":7347.566999999999,"title":"003 Brandon Sanderson Mary Robinette Kowal (2020) The Original"},{"id":3,"start":7347.566999999999,"end":9813.553,"title":"004 Brandon Sanderson Mary Robinette Kowal (2020) The Original"},{"id":4,"start":9813.553,"end":12247.669,"title":"005 Brandon Sanderson Mary Robinette Kowal (2020) The Original"},{"id":5,"start":12247.669,"end":12267.052,"title":"006 Brandon Sanderson Mary Robinette Kowal (2020) The Original"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1ucg6c","ino":"12476742361236303689","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Reckoners 03","subtitle":"Calamity","author":"Brandon Sanderson","authorFL":"Brandon Sanderson","authorLF":"Sanderson, Brandon","narrator":"MacLeod Andrews","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2016","publisher":null,"description":"From the best-selling author of the Mistborn series and Words of Radiance comes Calamity, the final book in the New York Times best-selling Reckoners series.

When Calamity lit up the sky, the Epics were born. David's fate has been tied to their villainy ever since that historic night. Steelheart killed his father. Firefight stole his heart.

Newcago is free. They told David it was impossible, that even the Reckoners had never killed a High Epic. Yet Steelheart - invincible, immortal, unconquerable - is dead. And he died by David's hand. Eliminating Steelheart was supposed to make life simpler. Instead, it only made David realize he has questions. Big ones. And no one in Newcago can give him answers. Babylon Restored, the city formerly known as the borough of Manhattan, has possibilities, though. Ruled by the mysterious High Epic Regalia, Babylon Restored is flooded and miserable, but David is sure it's the path that will lead him to what he needs to find. Entering a city oppressed by a High Epic despot is risky, but David's willing to take the gamble. Because killing Steelheart left a hole in David's heart. A hole where his thirst for vengeance once lived. Somehow, he filled that hole with another Epic - Firefight. And now he will go on a quest darker and even more dangerous than the fight against Steelheart to find her, and to get his answers.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw1uj78t/BSFRXX-53 Brandon Sanderson -

It was a burst in the sky that gave ordinary men and women extraordinary powers. The awed public started calling them Epics. But Epics are no friend of man. With incredible gifts came the desire to rule. And to rule man you must crush his wills. Nobody fights the Epics...nobody but the Reckoners. A shadowy group of ordinary humans, they spend their lives studying Epics, finding their weaknesses, and then assassinating them. And David wants in. He wants Steelheart - the Epic who is said to be invincible. The Epic who killed David's father.  For years, like the Reckoners, David's been studying and planning - and he has something they need. Not an object but an experience. He's seen Steelheart bleed.

Kelsier, Vin, Elend, Sazed, Spook, and the rest are now part of history - or religion.  Yet even as science and technology are reaching new heights, the old magics of Allomancy and Feruchemy continue to play a role in this reborn world. Out in the frontier lands known as the Roughs, they are crucial tools for the brave men and women attempting to establish order and justice. One such is Waxillium Ladrian, a rare Twinborn, who can Push on metals with his Allomancy and use Feruchemy to become lighter or heavier at will.  After 20 years in the Roughs, Wax has been forced by family tragedy to return to the metropolis of Elendel. Now he must reluctantly put away his guns and assume the duties and dignity incumbent upon the head of a noble house. Or so he thinks, until he learns the hard way that the mansions and elegant tree-lined streets of the city can be even more dangerous than the dusty plains of the Roughs.  Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson: The Cosmere The Stormlight Archive The Way of Kings Words of Radiance Edgedancer (Novella) Oathbringer  The Mistborn trilogy: Mistborn: The Final Empire The Well of Ascension The Hero of Ages Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series: Alloy of Law Shadows of Self Bands of Mourning Collection Arcanum Unbounded Other Cosmere novels: Elantris Warbreaker The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series: Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians The Scrivener's Bones The Knights of Crystallia The Shattered Lens The Dark Talent The Rithmatist series: The Rithmatist Other books by Brandon Sanderson: The Reckoners Steelheart Firefight Calamity","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1v85aw/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637053422047,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Brandon Sanderson/Mistborn 04 - The Alloy of Law","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Brandon Sanderson/Mistborn 04 - The Alloy of Law","addedAt":1637053230665,"lastUpdate":1637053422047,"duration":38895292,"size":238721457,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":22,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":1490.025,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - The Alloy of Law 01 of 22"},{"id":1,"start":1490.025,"end":3456.013,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - The Alloy of Law 02 of 22"},{"id":2,"start":3456.013,"end":6149.807,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - The Alloy of Law 03 of 22"},{"id":3,"start":6149.807,"end":7799.074,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - The Alloy of Law 04 of 22"},{"id":4,"start":7799.074,"end":10263.13,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - The Alloy of Law 05 of 22"},{"id":5,"start":10263.13,"end":11743.030999999999,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - The Alloy of Law 06 of 22"},{"id":6,"start":11743.030999999999,"end":14167.472999999998,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - The Alloy of Law 07 of 22"},{"id":7,"start":14167.472999999998,"end":15842.978999999998,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - The Alloy of Law 08 of 22"},{"id":8,"start":15842.978999999998,"end":17216.160999999996,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - The Alloy of Law 09 of 22"},{"id":9,"start":17216.160999999996,"end":19365.074999999997,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - The Alloy of Law 10 of 22"},{"id":10,"start":19365.074999999997,"end":21194.761,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - The Alloy of Law 11 of 22"},{"id":11,"start":21194.761,"end":22880.716,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - The Alloy of Law 12 of 22"},{"id":12,"start":22880.716,"end":23991.002,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - The Alloy of Law 13 of 22"},{"id":13,"start":23991.002,"end":25937.253,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - The Alloy of Law 14 of 22"},{"id":14,"start":25937.253,"end":27747.481,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - The Alloy of Law 15 of 22"},{"id":15,"start":27747.481,"end":29658.391,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - The Alloy of Law 16 of 22"},{"id":16,"start":29658.391,"end":30661.494,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - The Alloy of Law 17 of 22"},{"id":17,"start":30661.494,"end":32230.094999999998,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - The Alloy of Law 18 of 22"},{"id":18,"start":32230.094999999998,"end":34370.093,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - The Alloy of Law 19 of 22"},{"id":19,"start":34370.093,"end":36401.561,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - The Alloy of Law 20 of 22"},{"id":20,"start":36401.561,"end":37206.133,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - The Alloy of Law 21 of 22"},{"id":21,"start":37206.133,"end":38895.292,"title":"Brandon Sanderson - The Alloy of Law 22 of 22"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1vc97g","ino":"4709916502122790592","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Mistborn 03","subtitle":"The Hero Of Ages","author":"Brandon Sanderson","authorFL":"Brandon Sanderson","authorLF":"Sanderson, Brandon","narrator":"Michael Kramer","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2008","publisher":null,"description":"From number one New York Times best-selling author Brandon Sanderson, the Mistborn series is a heist story of political intrigue and magical, martial-arts action.  Who is the Hero of Ages?  To end the Final Empire and restore freedom, Vin killed the Lord Ruler. But as a result, the Deepness - the lethal form of the ubiquitous mists - is back, along with increasingly heavy ashfalls and ever more powerful earthquakes. Humanity appears to be doomed.  Having escaped death at the climax of The Well of Ascension only by becoming a Mistborn himself, Emperor Elend Venture hopes to find clues left behind by the Lord Ruler that will allow him to save the world. Vin is consumed with guilt at having been tricked into releasing the mystic force known as Ruin from the Well. Ruin wants to end the world, and its near omniscience and ability to warp reality make stopping it seem impossible. She can't even discuss it with Elend, lest Ruin learn their plans!  The conclusion of the Mistborn trilogy fulfills all the promise of the first two books. Revelations abound, connections rooted in early chapters of the series click into place, and surprises, as satisfying as they are stunning, blossom like fireworks to dazzle and delight. It all leads up to a finale unmatched for originality and audacity that will leave listeners shaking their heads in wonder, as if awaking from an amazing dream.   Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson: The Cosmere The Stormlight Archive The Way of Kings Words of Radiance Edgedancer (Novella) Oathbringer  The Mistborn trilogy: Mistborn: The Final Empire The Well of Ascension The Hero of Ages Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series: Alloy of Law Shadows of Self Bands of Mourning Collection Arcanum Unbounded Other Cosmere novels: Elantris Warbreaker The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series: Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians The Scrivener's Bones The Knights of Crystallia The Shattered Lens The Dark Talent The Rithmatist series: The Rithmatist Other books by Brandon Sanderson: The Reckoners Steelheart Firefight Calamity","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1vc97g/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637054023347,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Brandon Sanderson/Mistborn 03 -

Guns of the Dawn is a pacey, gripping fantasy of war and magic from Arthur C. Clarke Award-winning author Adrian Tchaikovsky. The first casualty of war is truth.... First, Denland's revolutionaries assassinated their king, launching a wave of bloodshed after generations of peace. Next they clashed with Lascanne, their royalist neighbour, pitching war machines against warlocks in a fiercely fought conflict. Genteel Emily Marshwic watched as the hostilities stole her family's young men. But then came the call for yet more Lascanne soldiers in a ravaged kingdom with none left to give.

Scott Bakker's Prince of Nothing series creates a remarkable world from whole cloth - its language and classes of people, its cities, religions, mysteries, taboos, and rituals - the kind of all-embracing universe Tolkien and Herbert created unforgettably in the epic fantasies The Lord of the Rings and Dune. It's a world scarred by an apocalyptic past, evoking a time both 2,000 years past and 2,000 years into the future, as untold thousands gather for a crusade. Among them, two men and two women are ensnared by a mysterious traveler, Anasûrimbor Kellhus - part warrior, part philosopher, part sorcerous, charismatic presence - from lands long thought dead. The Darkness That Comes Before is a history of this great holy war, and like all histories, the survivors write its conclusion.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw21alwy/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637063542967,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"R Scott Bakker/Prince Of Nothing/01 The Darkness That Comes Before","fullPath":"/audiobooks/R Scott Bakker/Prince Of Nothing/01 The Darkness That Comes Before","addedAt":1637063423460,"lastUpdate":1637063542967,"duration":74651699,"size":911900958,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":19,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":7013.617,"title":"The Darkness That Comes Before 01"},{"id":1,"start":7013.617,"end":9692.266,"title":"The Darkness That Comes Before 02"},{"id":2,"start":9692.266,"end":13662.774,"title":"The Darkness That Comes Before 03"},{"id":3,"start":13662.774,"end":16625.87,"title":"The Darkness That Comes Before 04"},{"id":4,"start":16625.87,"end":20646.742,"title":"The Darkness That Comes Before 05"},{"id":5,"start":20646.742,"end":25378.85,"title":"The Darkness That Comes Before 06"},{"id":6,"start":25378.85,"end":29273.551,"title":"The Darkness That Comes Before 07"},{"id":7,"start":29273.551,"end":33009.871,"title":"The Darkness That Comes Before 08"},{"id":8,"start":33009.871,"end":35348.04,"title":"The Darkness That Comes Before 09"},{"id":9,"start":35348.04,"end":39317.085,"title":"The Darkness That Comes Before 10"},{"id":10,"start":39317.085,"end":42931.936,"title":"The Darkness That Comes Before 11"},{"id":11,"start":42931.936,"end":47459.845,"title":"The Darkness That Comes Before 12"},{"id":12,"start":47459.845,"end":52154.807,"title":"The Darkness That Comes Before 13"},{"id":13,"start":52154.807,"end":55231.719,"title":"The Darkness That Comes Before 14"},{"id":14,"start":55231.719,"end":59775.746,"title":"The Darkness That Comes Before 15"},{"id":15,"start":59775.746,"end":64420.971,"title":"The Darkness That Comes Before 16"},{"id":16,"start":64420.971,"end":69073.928,"title":"The Darkness That Comes Before 17"},{"id":17,"start":69073.928,"end":72570.314,"title":"The Darkness That Comes Before 18"},{"id":18,"start":72570.314,"end":74651.699,"title":"The Darkness That Comes Before 19"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw21mrrh","ino":"3623838874761322947","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"02","subtitle":"Grass For His Pillow","author":"Lian Hearn","authorFL":"Lian Hearn","authorLF":"Hearn, Lian","narrator":"Aiko Nakasone; Kevin Gray","series":"Tales of Otori","volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2003","publisher":null,"description":"Grass for His Pillow is the second novel in Lian Hearn's astonishingly beautiful series inspired by feudal Japan, Tales of the Otori. In the ancient Oriental lands of the Otori, amidst a time of violent war, famine and treacherous alliances, the fate of the young lovers Otori Takeo and Shirakawa Kaede hangs in the balance.... Takeo, heir to the great Otori clan, has pledged his life to the secret Tribe. His supernatural skills of virtual invisibility and acute hearing make him their most deadly assassin. But he must deny the solemn oath of vengeance he made, his adopted birthright of wealth, land and power - and his love for Kaede. If he does not devote himself entirely to the brutal ways of the Tribe, they will kill him. Whichever path he chooses, it will lead to hardship and sacrifice in the bitter winter of the high mountains and test him to the limits of his being. Kaede, heiress to vast lands, is now the valuable pawn of ruthless warlords. She must use her intelligence, beauty and cunning to assert her place in a world of all-powerful men - who must never suspect the dangerous secret she hides.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw21mrrh/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637064044252,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Lian Hearn/Tales of Otori/02 - Grass For His Pillow","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Lian Hearn/Tales of Otori/02 - Grass For His Pillow","addedAt":1637063990933,"lastUpdate":1637064044252,"duration":34004542,"size":276204366,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":8,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":4735.08,"title":"Lian Hearn - Tales of the Otori - Book 2 - Grass for His Pillow - 01"},{"id":1,"start":4735.08,"end":9608.113000000001,"title":"Lian Hearn - Tales of the Otori - Book 2 - Grass for His Pillow - 02"},{"id":2,"start":9608.113000000001,"end":14366.495,"title":"Lian Hearn - Tales of the Otori - Book 2 - Grass for His Pillow - 03"},{"id":3,"start":14366.495,"end":18974.829,"title":"Lian Hearn - Tales of the Otori - Book 2 - Grass for His Pillow - 04"},{"id":4,"start":18974.829,"end":23696.169,"title":"Lian Hearn - Tales of the Otori - Book 2 - Grass for His Pillow - 05"},{"id":5,"start":23696.169,"end":28335.067000000003,"title":"Lian Hearn - Tales of the Otori - Book 2 - Grass for His Pillow - 06"},{"id":6,"start":28335.067000000003,"end":32934.964,"title":"Lian Hearn - Tales of the Otori - Book 2 - Grass for His Pillow - 07"},{"id":7,"start":32934.964,"end":34004.542,"title":"Lian Hearn - Tales of the Otori - Book 2 - Grass for His Pillow - 08"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw22avvl","ino":"9785577381398126858","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"A Time of Courage","subtitle":null,"author":"John Gwynne","authorFL":"John Gwynne","authorLF":"Gwynne, John","narrator":"Damian Lynch","series":"Of Blood and Bone","volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2020","publisher":null,"description":"Heroes shall rise and fall, the earth shall be stained red, and the fate of the Banished Lands will be decided once and for all in A Time of Courage, the final audiobook in acclaimed fantasy author John Gwynne's Of Blood and Bone trilogy. The demon king Asroth has been freed from his iron prison. Now, alongside his dark bride, Fritha, he plans to conquer the whole of the Banished Lands. In the shadows of Forn Forest, Riv and the surviving Ben-Elim desperately search for a way to unite those who remain against Asroth's vast army. Far in the west, Drem is with the Order of the Bright Star, besieged by a demon horde. Their fragile defenses are on the brink of shattering, but they know that it is better to fight and die than to live without hope. And across the Banished Lands, armies are heading south, to settle ancient grudges and decide the fate of humanity.

Exciting, action-packed fantasy.\" (Mark Lawrence) Defy the darkness. Defend the light. Drem and his friends are haunted by the horrors they witnessed at the battle at Starstone Lake: the screams of men being warped into beasts and the sight of a demon rising from the dead. But worse than any memory is Fritha, the demons' deadly high priestess. And she is hunting them. Concealed in Forn Forest, Riv knows her very existence is a threat to the Ben-Elim. She represents their most dangerous secret, and if the warrior angels find her, they won't hesitate to silence her.  As the demonic forces multiply, they send a mighty host to overthrow the angel's stronghold. Like heroes of old, Drem, Riv, and the Bright Star's warriors must battle to save themselves and save their land. But can the light triumph when the dark is rising?

R. Martin, Brandon Sanderson, and David Gemmell. Events are coming to a climax in the Banished Lands, as the war reaches new heights. King Nathair has taken control of the fortress at Drassil and three of the Seven Treasures are in his possession. And together with Calidus and his ally Queen Rhin, Nathair will do anything to obtain the remaining Treasures. With all seven under his command, he can open a portal to the Otherworld. Then Asroth and his demon-horde will finally break into the Banished Lands and become flesh. Meanwhile Corban has been taken prisoner by the Jotun, warrior giants who ride their enormous bears into battle. His warband scattered, Corban must make new allies if he hopes to survive. But can he bond with competing factions of warlike giants? Somehow he must, if he's to counter the threat Nathair represents. His life hangs in the balance - and with it, the fate of the Banished Lands.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw22pin3/Wrath (Audio).jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/John Gwynne/Faithful and the Fallen/04 -

His daughter and two sons, scattered across the world, do what they must to stay alive and unmask the assassins. But each of them also has a life-path on which their father set them, destinies entangled with both ancient enemies and inscrutable gods. Kaden, the heir to the Unhewn Throne, has spent eight years sequestered in a remote mountain monastery, learning the enigmatic discipline of monks devoted to the Blank God. Their rituals hold the key to an ancient power he must master before it's too late. An ocean away, Valyn endures the brutal training of the Kettral, elite soldiers who fly into battle on gigantic black hawks. But before he can set out to save Kaden, Valyn must survive one horrific final test. At the heart of the empire, Minister Adare, elevated to her station by one of the emperor's final acts, is determined to prove herself to her people. But Adare also believes she knows who murdered her father, and she will stop at nothing - and risk everything - to see that justice is meted out.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw26lnrk/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637072341380,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Brian Staveley/The Unhewn Throne/01 - Emperors Blades","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Brian Staveley/The Unhewn Throne/01 - Emperors Blades","addedAt":1637072337285,"lastUpdate":1637072341380,"duration":67573969,"size":1095341541,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":1,"chapters":[],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw26lrmh","ino":"17854887765178592771","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"03","subtitle":"The Autumn Republic","author":"Brian Mclellan","authorFL":"Brian Mclellan","authorLF":"Mclellan, Brian","narrator":"Christian Rodska","series":"Powder Mage","volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2015","publisher":null,"description":"Adopest has fallen....  Field Marshal Tamas returns to his beloved country to find that for the first time in history, the capital city of Adro lies in the hands of a foreign invader.

But it also provokes war in the Nine Nations, internal attacks by royalist fanatics and greedy scrambling for money and power by Tamas' supposed allies: the Church, workers' unions, and mercenary forces. Stretched to his limit, Tamas relies heavily on his few remaining powder mages, including the embittered Taniel, a brilliant marksman who also happens to be Tamas' estranged son, and Adamat, a retired police inspector whose loyalty will be tested to its limit.

What signs these shall be, I say unto you: first the earth will flow with the blood of Aen Seidhe, the Blood of Elves.... For over a century, humans, dwarves, gnomes, and elves have lived together in relative peace. But times have changed, the uneasy peace is over, and now the races are fighting once again. The only good elf, it seems, is a dead elf. Geralt of Rivia, the cunning assassin known as The Witcher, has been waiting for the birth of a prophesied child.

Victor and Eli started out as college roommates - brilliant, arrogant, lonely boys who recognized the same sharpness and ambition in each other. In their senior year, a shared research interest in adrenaline, near-death experiences, and seemingly supernatural events reveals an intriguing possibility: that under the right conditions, someone could develop extraordinary abilities. But when their thesis moves from the academic to the experimental, things go horribly wrong. Ten years later, Victor breaks out of prison, determined to catch up to his old friend (now foe), and aided by a young girl whose reserved nature obscures a stunning ability. Meanwhile, Eli is on a mission to eradicate every other super-powered person that he can find - aside from his sidekick, an enigmatic woman with an unbreakable will. Armed with terrible power on both sides, driven by the memory of betrayal and loss, the arch nemeses have set a course for revenge - but who will be left alive at the end? In Vicious, V. E. Schwab brings to life a gritty comic-book-style world in vivid prose: a world where gaining superpowers doesn’t automatically lead to heroism, and a time when allegiances are called into question.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw089eon/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction &

The trilogy inspired a generation of modern fantasy writers, including George R. R. Martin, Patrick Rothfuss, and Christopher Paolini and defined Tad Williams as one of the most important fantasy writers of our time. Book 3: To Green Angel Tower The evil minions of the undead Sithi Storm King are beginning their final preparations for the kingdom-shattering culmination of their dark sorceries, drawing King Elias ever deeper into their nightmarish, spell-spun world. As the Storm King's power grows and the boundaries of time begin to blur, the loyal allies of Prince Josua struggle to rally their forces at the Stone of Farewell. There, too, Simon and the surviving members of the League of the Scroll have gathered for a desperate attempt to unravel mysteries from the forgotten past. For if the League can reclaim these age-old secrets of magic long-buried beneath the dusts of time, they may be able to reveal to Josua and his army the only means of striking down the unslayable foe. After the landmark Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn trilogy, the epic saga of Osten Ard continues with the brand-new novel The Heart of What Was Lost. Then don't miss the upcoming trilogy The Last King of Osten Ard, beginning with The Witchwood Crown!","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0c9tn5/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Action & Adventure"],"lastUpdate":1636996953603,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Tad Williams/To Green Angel Tower","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Tad Williams/To Green Angel Tower","addedAt":1636960929947,"lastUpdate":1636996953603,"duration":227405496,"size":1808306552,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":75,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":80.0,"title":"Chapter 0 (Opening Credits)"},{"id":1,"start":80.0,"end":868.0,"title":"Chapter 1 (Synopsis of The Dragonbone Chair)"},{"id":2,"start":868.0,"end":1990.0,"title":"Chapter 2 (Synopsis of Stone of Farewell)"},{"id":3,"start":1990.0,"end":3052.0,"title":"Chapter 3 (Foreword)"},{"id":4,"start":3052.0,"end":3063.0,"title":"Chapter 4 (Part One: The Waiting Stone)"},{"id":5,"start":3063.0,"end":6681.0,"title":"Chapter 5 (1.

He was born an outsider, like the rest of his family. Poor yet resilient, he lives in the shadows with his aunt Libby and uncle Darren, folk who stubbornly make their way in a society that does not understand or want them. They are mongrels, mixed blood, neither this nor that. The boy at the center of Mongrels must decide if he belongs on the road with his aunt and uncle or if he fits with the people on the other side of the tracks. For 10 years he and his family have lived a life of late-night exits and narrow escapes - always on the move across the South to stay one step ahead of the law. But the time is drawing near when Darren and Libby will finally know if their nephew is like them or not. And the close calls they've been running from for so long are catching up fast now. Everything is about to change. A compelling and fascinating journey, Mongrels alternates between past and present to create an unforgettable portrait of a boy trying to understand his family and his place in a complex and unforgiving world. A smart and innovative story - funny, bloody, raw, and real - told in a rhythmic voice full of heart, Mongrels is a deeply moving, sometimes grisly novel that illuminates the challenges and tender joys of a life beyond the ordinary in a bold and imaginative new way.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw0e0192/folder.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Stephen Graham Jones/Mongrels/folder.jpg","genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1636963889678,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Stephen Graham Jones/Mongrels","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Stephen Graham Jones/Mongrels","addedAt":1636963832707,"lastUpdate":1636963889678,"duration":34910802,"size":566604120,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":10,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":3381.421,"title":"Stephen Graham Jones - Mongrels [01-10]"},{"id":1,"start":3381.421,"end":6292.821,"title":"Stephen Graham Jones - Mongrels [02-10]"},{"id":2,"start":6292.821,"end":10275.189,"title":"Stephen Graham Jones - Mongrels [03-10]"},{"id":3,"start":10275.189,"end":13734.768,"title":"Stephen Graham Jones - Mongrels [04-10]"},{"id":4,"start":13734.768,"end":17504.786,"title":"Stephen Graham Jones - Mongrels [05-10]"},{"id":5,"start":17504.786,"end":21705.093,"title":"Stephen Graham Jones - Mongrels [06-10]"},{"id":6,"start":21705.093,"end":25108.927,"title":"Stephen Graham Jones - Mongrels [07-10]"},{"id":7,"start":25108.927,"end":28256.395,"title":"Stephen Graham Jones - Mongrels [08-10]"},{"id":8,"start":28256.395,"end":31625.695,"title":"Stephen Graham Jones - Mongrels [09-10]"},{"id":9,"start":31625.695,"end":34910.801999999996,"title":"Stephen Graham Jones - Mongrels [10-10]"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0ebpd6","ino":"8874455309269507606","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Rule of Two","subtitle":null,"author":"Drew Karpyshyn","authorFL":"Star Wars","authorLF":"Wars, Star","narrator":"Jonathan Davis","series":"Darth Bane","volumeNumber":"2","publishYear":"2012","publisher":null,"description":"In the New York Times best-seller Darth Bane: Path of Destruction, Drew Karpyshyn painted a gripping portrait of a young man’s journey from innocence to evil. That man was Darth Bane, a twisted genius whose iron will, fierce ambition, and strength in the dark side of the Force made him a natural leader among the Sith - until his radical embrace of an all-but-forgotten wisdom drove him to destroy his own order...and create it anew from the ashes. As the last surviving Sith, Darth Bane promulgated a harsh new directive: the Rule of Two. Two there should be; no more, no less. One to embody the power, the other to crave it. Now Darth Bane is ready to put his policy into action, and he thinks he has found the key element that will make his triumph complete: a student to train in the ways of the dark side. Though she is young, Zannah possesses an instinctive link to the dark side that rivals his own. With his guidance, she will become essential in his quest to destroy the Jedi and dominate the galaxy. But there is one who is determined to stop Darth Bane: Johun Othone, Padawan to Jedi Master Lord Hoth, who died at Bane’s hands in the last great Sith War. Though the rest of the Jedi scoff at him, Joshua’s belief that there are surviving Sith on the loose is unshakeable. As Johun continues his dogged pursuit of the man who killed his master, Zannah, faced unexpectedly with a figure from her past, begins to question her embrace of the dark side. And Darth Bane is led by Force-induced visions to a moon where he will acquire astonishing new knowledge and power - power that will alter him in ways he could never have imagined....","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw0ebpd6/Drew Karpyshyn - Rule of Two.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Star Wars/02 - Rule of Two/Drew Karpyshyn - Rule of Two.jpg","genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Science Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1636996914842,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Star Wars/02 - Rule of Two","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Star Wars/02 - Rule of Two","addedAt":1636964376436,"lastUpdate":1636996914842,"duration":36749719,"size":596200644,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":9,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":4305.424,"title":"Drew Karpyshyn - Rule of Two 1-9"},{"id":1,"start":4305.424,"end":8066.978999999999,"title":"Drew Karpyshyn - Rule of Two 2-9"},{"id":2,"start":8066.978999999999,"end":12164.416,"title":"Drew Karpyshyn - Rule of Two 3-9"},{"id":3,"start":12164.416,"end":16797.886,"title":"Drew Karpyshyn - Rule of Two 4-9"},{"id":4,"start":16797.886,"end":20398.944,"title":"Drew Karpyshyn - Rule of Two 5-9"},{"id":5,"start":20398.944,"end":24421.645,"title":"Drew Karpyshyn - Rule of Two 6-9"},{"id":6,"start":24421.645,"end":28211.308,"title":"Drew Karpyshyn - Rule of Two 7-9"},{"id":7,"start":28211.308,"end":32395.524,"title":"Drew Karpyshyn - Rule of Two 8-9"},{"id":8,"start":32395.524,"end":36749.719,"title":"Drew Karpyshyn - Rule of Two 9-9"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0eju88","ino":"5928308220216405730","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Plague Arcanist","subtitle":null,"author":"Shami Stovall","authorFL":"Shami Stovall","authorLF":"Stovall, Shami","narrator":"Brian Wiggins","series":"Frith Chronicles","volumeNumber":"4","publishYear":"2020","publisher":null,"description":"Deserts.

Sailing. A murderer among heroes. Gravedigger Volke Savan wants nothing more than to be like his hero, the legendary magical swashbuckler, Gregory Ruma. First he needs to become an arcanist, someone capable of wielding magic, which requires bonding with a mythical creature. And he’ll take anything - a pegasus, a griffin, a ravenous hydra - maybe even a leviathan, like Ruma. So when Volke stumbles across a knightmare, a creature made of shadow and terror, he has no reservations. But the knightmare knows a terrible secret: Ruma is a murderer out to spread corrupted magic throughout their island nation.

At least, he's not a beast all the time. As she adapts to her new home, her feelings for the faerie, Tamlin, transform from icy hostility into a fiery passion that burns through every lie she's been told about the beautiful, dangerous world of the Fae. But something is not right in the faerie lands. An ancient, wicked shadow is growing, and Feyre must find a way to stop it, or doom Tamlin-and his world-forever. From bestselling author Sarah J.

Queen Daleina has yearned to bring peace and prosperity to her beloved forest home - a hope that seemed doomed when neighboring forces invaded Aratay. Now, with the powerful Queen Naelin ruling by her side, Daleina believes that her dream of ushering in a new era can be realized, even in a land plagued by malevolent nature spirits who thirst for the end of human life. And then Naelin’s children are kidnapped by spirits. Nothing is more important to her than her family, and Naelin would rather watch the world burn than see her children harmed. Blaming the defeated Queen Merecot of Semo for the kidnapping, Naelin is ready to start a war - and has the power to do it. But Merecot has grander plans than a bloody battle with her southern neighbors. Taking the children is merely one step in a plot to change the future of all Renthia, either by ending the threat of spirits once and for all ... or plunging the world into chaos.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0fobax/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Action & Adventure"],"lastUpdate":1636966862578,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Sarah Beth Durst/The Queen of Sorrow","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Sarah Beth Durst/The Queen of Sorrow","addedAt":1636966644945,"lastUpdate":1636966862578,"duration":55336470,"size":441507557,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":35,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":1117.993991,"title":"Chapter 0 (Chapter 1)"},{"id":1,"start":1117.993991,"end":2219.9939910000003,"title":"Chapter 1 (Chapter 2)"},{"id":2,"start":2219.9939910000003,"end":2925.9939910000003,"title":"Chapter 2 (Chapter 3)"},{"id":3,"start":2925.9939910000003,"end":4234.993991,"title":"Chapter 3 (Chapter 4)"},{"id":4,"start":4234.993991,"end":5244.993991,"title":"Chapter 4 (Chapter 5)"},{"id":5,"start":5244.993991,"end":6244.993991,"title":"Chapter 5 (Chapter 6)"},{"id":6,"start":6244.993991,"end":8575.993991,"title":"Chapter 6 (Chapter 7)"},{"id":7,"start":8575.993991,"end":10612.993991,"title":"Chapter 7 (Chapter 8)"},{"id":8,"start":10612.993991,"end":13269.960997999999,"title":"Chapter 8 (Chapter 9)"},{"id":9,"start":13269.960997999999,"end":13950.960997999999,"title":"Chapter 9 (Chapter 10)"},{"id":10,"start":13950.960997999999,"end":15284.960997999999,"title":"Chapter 10 (Chapter 11)"},{"id":11,"start":15284.960997999999,"end":18010.960998,"title":"Chapter 11 (Chapter 12)"},{"id":12,"start":18010.960998,"end":19713.960998,"title":"Chapter 12 (Chapter 13)"},{"id":13,"start":19713.960998,"end":22374.960998,"title":"Chapter 13 (Chapter 14)"},{"id":14,"start":22374.960998,"end":24667.960998,"title":"Chapter 14 (Chapter 15)"},{"id":15,"start":24667.960998,"end":26275.942992999997,"title":"Chapter 15 (Chapter 16)"},{"id":16,"start":26275.942992999997,"end":28535.942992999997,"title":"Chapter 16 (Chapter 17)"},{"id":17,"start":28535.942992999997,"end":30295.942992999997,"title":"Chapter 17 (Chapter 18)"},{"id":18,"start":30295.942992999997,"end":30924.924987999995,"title":"Chapter 18 (Chapter 19)"},{"id":19,"start":30924.924987999995,"end":31663.924987999995,"title":"Chapter 19 (Chapter 20)"},{"id":20,"start":31663.924987999995,"end":32792.924988,"title":"Chapter 20 (Chapter 21)"},{"id":21,"start":32792.924988,"end":34959.924988,"title":"Chapter 21 (Chapter 22)"},{"id":22,"start":34959.924988,"end":36415.924988,"title":"Chapter 22 (Chapter 23)"},{"id":23,"start":36415.924988,"end":37838.924988,"title":"Chapter 23 (Chapter 24)"},{"id":24,"start":37838.924988,"end":40295.924988,"title":"Chapter 24 (Chapter 25)"},{"id":25,"start":40295.924988,"end":41255.924988,"title":"Chapter 25 (Chapter 26)"},{"id":26,"start":41255.924988,"end":43636.924988,"title":"Chapter 26 (Chapter 27)"},{"id":27,"start":43636.924988,"end":45836.924988,"title":"Chapter 27 (Chapter 28)"},{"id":28,"start":45836.924988,"end":46808.924988,"title":"Chapter 28 (Chapter 29)"},{"id":29,"start":46808.924988,"end":47674.924988,"title":"Chapter 29 (Chapter 30)"},{"id":30,"start":47674.924988,"end":48665.924988,"title":"Chapter 30 (Chapter 31)"},{"id":31,"start":48665.924988,"end":49614.924988,"title":"Chapter 31 (Chapter 32)"},{"id":32,"start":49614.924988,"end":51088.924988,"title":"Chapter 32 (Chapter 33)"},{"id":33,"start":51088.924988,"end":52070.924988,"title":"Chapter 33 (Chapter 34)"},{"id":34,"start":52070.924988,"end":55319.924988,"title":"Chapter 34 (Chapter 35)"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0gsmcq","ino":"17493474767874927139","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"The Kingdom of Copper","subtitle":null,"author":"S.A.

But they could not have staved off invasion without the powerful dragon, Tintaglia. In return, the Traders promised to help her serpents migrate up the Rain Wild River after a long exile at sea - to find a safe haven and, Tintaglia hopes, to restore her species. But too much time has passed, and the newly hatched dragons are damaged and weak, and many die. The few who survive cannot use their wings; earthbound, they are powerless to hunt and vulnerable to human predators willing to kill them for the fabled healing powers of dragon flesh. But Tintaglia has vanished, and the Traders are weary of the labor and expense of tending useless dragons. The Trader leadership fears that if it stops providing for the young dragons, the hungry and neglected creatures will rampage - or die along the river’s acidic muddy banks. To avert catastrophe, the dragons decree a move even farther up the treacherous river to Kelsingra, their ancient, mythical homeland whose mysterious location is locked deep within the dragons’ uncertain ancestral memories. To ensure their safe passage, the Traders recruit a disparate group of young people to care for the damaged creatures and escort them to their new home. Among them is Thymara, an unschooled forest girl of 16, and Alise, a wealthy Trader’s wife trapped in a loveless marriage, who attaches herself to the expedition as a dragon expert. The two women share a deep kinship with the dragons: Thymara can instinctively communicate with them, and Alise, captivated by their beauty and majesty, has devoted her life to studying them. Embarking on an arduous journey that holds no promise of return, the band of humans and dragons must make its way along the toxic and inhospitable Rain Wild River - an extraordinary odyssey that will teach them lessons about themselves and one another as they experience hardships, betrayals, and joys beyond their wildest dreams.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw0hmn4f/The Dragon

Fool","volumeNumber":"2","publishYear":"2015","publisher":null,"description":"New York Times best seller Named One of the Best Books of the Year by Buzzfeed and The Independent Ranking alongside George R. R. Martin as a groundbreaking master of fantasy, Robin Hobb delivers the second book in her long-awaited Fitz and the Fool trilogy. The harrowing adventures of FitzChivalry Farseer and his enigmatic friend the Fool continue in Robin Hobb’s triumphant follow-up to Fool’s Assassin. But Fool’s Quest is more than just a sequel. With the artistry and imagination her fans have come to expect, Hobb builds masterfully on all that has gone before, revealing devastating secrets and shocking conspiracies that cast a dark shadow over the history of Fitz and his world - a shadow that now stretches to darken all future hope. Long ago, Fitz and the Fool changed the world, bringing back the magic of dragons and securing both the Farseer succession and the stability of the kingdom. Or so they thought. But now the Fool is near death, maimed by mysterious pale-skinned figures whose plans for world domination hinge upon the powers the Fool may share with Fitz’s own daughter. Distracted by the Fool’s perilous health, and swept up against his will in the intrigues of the royal court, Fitz lets down his guard . . . and in a horrible instant, his world is undone and his beloved daughter stolen away by those who would use her as they had once sought to use the Fool - as a weapon. But FitzChivalry Farseer is not without weapons of his own. An ancient magic still lives in his veins. And though he may have let his skills as royal assassin diminish over the years, such things, once learned, are not so easily forgotten. Now enemies and friends alike are about to learn that nothing is more dangerous than a man who has nothing left to lose. Praise for Fool’s Quest “A complex tapestry of adventure, betrayal, destiny, and unrelenting peril... Hobb’s expertise is evident as always.” (Publishers Weekly) “Glorious and beautiful storytelling... Hobb lets rip with revelations, treachery, vengeance, sword fights and full on magical mayhem.” (SciFiNow) “If readers have any doubt that Robin Hobb is one of the finest writers in the fantasy genre, then they haven’t read any of her work.” (SFFWorld)","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0j55ei/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Action & Adventure"],"lastUpdate":1636972836775,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Robin Hobb/Fitz and the Fool 02 - Fool's Quest","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Robin Hobb/Fitz and the Fool 02 - Fool's Quest","addedAt":1636972469529,"lastUpdate":1636972836775,"duration":119526828,"size":950953599,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":38,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":4450.0,"title":"Chapter 0 (Chapter One)"},{"id":1,"start":4450.0,"end":5930.969002,"title":"Chapter 1 (Chapter Two)"},{"id":2,"start":5930.969002,"end":8880.969002,"title":"Chapter 2 (Chapter Three)"},{"id":3,"start":8880.969002,"end":12548.969002,"title":"Chapter 3 (Chapter Four)"},{"id":4,"start":12548.969002,"end":15692.969002,"title":"Chapter 4 (Chapter Five)"},{"id":5,"start":15692.969002,"end":17884.969001999998,"title":"Chapter 5 (Chapter Six)"},{"id":6,"start":17884.969001999998,"end":21944.969001999998,"title":"Chapter 6 (Chapter Seven)"},{"id":7,"start":21944.969001999998,"end":24152.969001999998,"title":"Chapter 7 (Chapter Eight)"},{"id":8,"start":24152.969001999998,"end":27852.969001999998,"title":"Chapter 8 (Chapter Nine)"},{"id":9,"start":27852.969001999998,"end":31299.969001999998,"title":"Chapter 9 (Chapter Ten)"},{"id":10,"start":31299.969001999998,"end":35202.969002,"title":"Chapter 10 (Chapter Eleven)"},{"id":11,"start":35202.969002,"end":37825.969002,"title":"Chapter 11 (Chapter Twelve)"},{"id":12,"start":37825.969002,"end":41141.969002,"title":"Chapter 12 (Chapter Thirteen)"},{"id":13,"start":41141.969002,"end":44268.969002,"title":"Chapter 13 (Chapter Fourteen)"},{"id":14,"start":44268.969002,"end":47459.969002,"title":"Chapter 14 (Chapter Fifteen)"},{"id":15,"start":47459.969002,"end":48357.969002,"title":"Chapter 15 (Chapter Sixteen)"},{"id":16,"start":48357.969002,"end":51364.969002,"title":"Chapter 16 (Chapter Seventeen)"},{"id":17,"start":51364.969002,"end":53712.969002,"title":"Chapter 17 (Chapter Eighteen)"},{"id":18,"start":53712.969002,"end":60051.969002,"title":"Chapter 18 (Chapter Nineteen)"},{"id":19,"start":60051.969002,"end":64202.969002,"title":"Chapter 19 (Chapter Twenty)"},{"id":20,"start":64202.969002,"end":66050.969002,"title":"Chapter 20 (Chapter Twenty-One)"},{"id":21,"start":66050.969002,"end":69074.95,"title":"Chapter 21 (Chapter Twenty-Two)"},{"id":22,"start":69074.95,"end":71982.95,"title":"Chapter 22 (Chapter Twenty-Three)"},{"id":23,"start":71982.95,"end":73850.95,"title":"Chapter 23 (Chapter Twenty-Four)"},{"id":24,"start":73850.95,"end":79534.95,"title":"Chapter 24 (Chapter Twenty-Five)"},{"id":25,"start":79534.95,"end":82286.95,"title":"Chapter 25 (Chapter Twenty-Six)"},{"id":26,"start":82286.95,"end":84315.95,"title":"Chapter 26 (Chapter Twenty-Seven)"},{"id":27,"start":84315.95,"end":87115.95,"title":"Chapter 27 (Chapter Twenty-Eight)"},{"id":28,"start":87115.95,"end":90027.95,"title":"Chapter 28 (Chapter Twenty-Nine)"},{"id":29,"start":90027.95,"end":94648.95,"title":"Chapter 29 (Chapter Thirty)"},{"id":30,"start":94648.95,"end":97284.95,"title":"Chapter 30 (Chapter Thirty-One)"},{"id":31,"start":97284.95,"end":102419.95,"title":"Chapter 31 (Chapter Thirty-Two)"},{"id":32,"start":102419.95,"end":105731.95,"title":"Chapter 32 (Chapter Thirty-Three)"},{"id":33,"start":105731.95,"end":109185.95,"title":"Chapter 33 (Chapter Thirty-Four)"},{"id":34,"start":109185.95,"end":111474.95,"title":"Chapter 34 (Chapter Thirty-Five)"},{"id":35,"start":111474.95,"end":115923.95,"title":"Chapter 35 (Chapter Thirty-Six)"},{"id":36,"start":115923.95,"end":119150.95,"title":"Chapter 36 (Chapter Thirty-Seven)"},{"id":37,"start":119150.95,"end":119506.95,"title":"Chapter 37 (Chapter Thirty-Eight)"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0l6gxp","ino":"2168350162232409302","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"The Eye of the World","subtitle":null,"author":"Robert Jordan","authorFL":"Robert Jordan","authorLF":"Jordan, Robert","narrator":"Kate Reading; Michael Kramer","series":"The Wheel of Time","volumeNumber":"1","publishYear":"1990","publisher":null,"description":"\"These veteran narrators keep the plot moving and the narration fresh\" (AudioFile Magazine) This program is read by Audie Award-winning narrators Michael Kramer and Kate Reading, and includes a bonus interview with the author. The Wheel of Time is a PBS Great American Read Selection! Now in development for TV! Since its debut in 1990, The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan has captivated millions of readers and listeners around the globe with its scope, originality, and compelling characters. The Wheel of Time turns and ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow. When The Two Rivers is attacked by Trollocs - a savage tribe of half-men, half-beasts - five villagers flee that night into a world they barely imagined, with new dangers waiting in the shadows and in the light.

Now in development for TV! Since its debut in 1990, The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan has captivated millions of readers and listeners around the globe with its scope, originality, and compelling characters. The Wheel of Time turns and ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow. Elayne, Aviendha, and Mat come ever closer to the bowl ter'angreal that may reverse the world's endless heat wave and restore natural weather. Egwene begins to gather all manner of women who can channel - Sea Folk, Windfinders, Wise Ones, and some surprising others.  And above all, Rand faces the dread Forsaken Sammael, in the shadows of Shadar Logoth, where the blood-hungry mist, Mashadar, waits for prey.  TV series update: \"Sony will produce along with Red Eagle Entertainment and Radar Pictures. Rafe Judkins is attached to write and executive produce. Judkins previously worked on shows such as ABC’s Agents of SHIELD, the Netflix series Hemlock Grove, and the NBC series Chuck. Red Eagle partners Rick Selvage and Larry Mondragon will executive produce along with Radar’s Ted Field and Mike Weber. Darren Lemke will also executive produce, with Jordan’s widow Harriet McDougal serving as consulting producer.\" (Variety) The Wheel of Time New Spring: The Novel The Eye of the World The Great Hunt The Dragon Reborn The Shadow Rising The Fires of Heaven Lord of Chaos A Crown of Swords The Path of Daggers Winter's Heart Crossroads of Twilight Knife of Dreams by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson The Gathering Storm Towers of Midnight A Memory of Light by Robert Jordan   Warrior of the Altaii by Robert Jordan and Teresa Patterson   The World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan, Harriet McDougal, Alan Romanczuk, and Maria Simons  The Wheel of Time Companion by Robert Jordan and Amy Romanczuk  Patterns of the Wheel: Coloring Art Based on Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0m6mw8/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1636995348159,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Robert Jordan/A Crown of Swords","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Robert Jordan/A Crown of Swords","addedAt":1636977577784,"lastUpdate":1636995348159,"duration":109511702,"size":1338333960,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":44,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":2525.623,"title":"Robert Jordan -

from one of America's most acclaimed young fantasy writers. The city of Bulikov once wielded the powers of the gods to conquer the world, enslaving and brutalizing millions - until its divine protectors were killed. Now Bulikov has become just another colonial outpost of the world's new geopolitical power, but the surreal landscape of the city itself - first shaped, now shattered, by the thousands of miracles its guardians once worked upon it - stands as a constant, haunting reminder of its former supremacy. Into this broken city steps Shara Thivani. Officially, the unassuming young woman is just another junior diplomat sent by Bulikov's oppressors. Unofficially, she is one of her country's most accomplished spies, dispatched to catch a murderer. But as Shara pursues the killer, she starts to suspect that the beings who ruled this terrible place may not be as dead as they seem - and that Bulikov's cruel reign may not yet be over.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0mnhye/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Thriller & Suspense"],"lastUpdate":1636978674121,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Robert Jackson Bennett/City of Stairs","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Robert Jackson Bennett/City of Stairs","addedAt":1636978363708,"lastUpdate":1636978674121,"duration":64237024,"size":393284178,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":26,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":2694.716,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 001"},{"id":1,"start":2694.716,"end":5923.061,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 002"},{"id":2,"start":5923.061,"end":9489.771,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 003"},{"id":3,"start":9489.771,"end":12286.992,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 004"},{"id":4,"start":12286.992,"end":14486.844000000001,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 005"},{"id":5,"start":14486.844000000001,"end":16827.0,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 006"},{"id":6,"start":16827.0,"end":19809.821,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 007"},{"id":7,"start":19809.821,"end":22753.51,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 008"},{"id":8,"start":22753.51,"end":25043.171,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 009"},{"id":9,"start":25043.171,"end":27527.339999999997,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 010"},{"id":10,"start":27527.339999999997,"end":29636.912999999997,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 011"},{"id":11,"start":29636.912999999997,"end":32658.472999999998,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 012"},{"id":12,"start":32658.472999999998,"end":33453.695,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 013"},{"id":13,"start":33453.695,"end":36835.902,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 014"},{"id":14,"start":36835.902,"end":40358.543000000005,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 015"},{"id":15,"start":40358.543000000005,"end":41880.361000000004,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 016"},{"id":16,"start":41880.361000000004,"end":44924.491,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 017"},{"id":17,"start":44924.491,"end":47799.243,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 018"},{"id":18,"start":47799.243,"end":50331.66,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 019"},{"id":19,"start":50331.66,"end":51859.199,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 020"},{"id":20,"start":51859.199,"end":54641.086,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 021"},{"id":21,"start":54641.086,"end":57692.556000000004,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 022"},{"id":22,"start":57692.556000000004,"end":59057.274000000005,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 023"},{"id":23,"start":59057.274000000005,"end":61266.635,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 024"},{"id":24,"start":61266.635,"end":64130.259000000005,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 025"},{"id":25,"start":64130.259000000005,"end":64237.024000000005,"title":"City of Stairs (Unabridged) - 026"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0n9jc2","ino":"1952517030890676438","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Winds of War","subtitle":null,"author":"Rhett C.

Simon Snow is the worst Chosen One who's ever been chosen. That's what his roommate, Baz, says. And Baz might be evil and a vampire and a complete git, but he's probably right. Half the time, Simon can't even make his wand work, and the other half, he starts something on fire. His mentor's avoiding him, his girlfriend broke up with him, and there's a magic-eating monster running around, wearing Simon's face. Baz would be having a field day with all this, if he were here - it's their last year at the Watford School of Magicks, and Simon's infuriating nemesis didn't even bother to show up. Carry On is a ghost story, a love story, and a mystery. It has just as much kissing and talking as you'd expect from a Rainbow Rowell story - but far, far more monsters.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0ohk6t/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Teen & Young

wrong. And in Wayward Son, they wondered whether everything they understood about themselves might be wrong.  In Any Way the Wind Blows, Simon and Baz and Penelope and Agatha have to decide how to move forward.  For Simon, that means deciding whether he still wants to be part of the World of Mages – and if he doesn't, what does that mean for his relationship with Baz? Meanwhile, Baz is bouncing between two family crises and not finding any time to talk to anyone about his newfound vampire knowledge. Penelope would love to help, but she's smuggled an American Normal into London, and now she isn't sure what to do with him. And Agatha? Well, Agatha Wellbelove has had enough.  Any Way the Wind Blows takes the gang back to England, back to Watford and back to their families for their longest and most emotionally wrenching adventure yet.  This audiobook is a finale. It tells secrets and answers questions and lays ghosts to rest.  Carry On was conceived as a book about Chosen One stories; Any Way the Wind Blows is an ending about endings. About catharsis and closure, and how we choose to move on from the traumas and triumphs that try to define us.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0orn5r/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Teen","Literature &

Suffice it to say, mysteries resolve, dragons war, pigeons abound, and Julius must risk himself in ways he never dreamed possible as Bob's grand plan finally comes to fruition. But the Great Seer of the Heartstrikers isn't the only one whose schemes are nearing completion. The Nameless End is coming, and even the machinations of the world's most brilliant dragon seer might not be enough to stop it. As the world comes crashing down, it's up Julius to prove what he's always known: that seers can be wrong, and Nice Dragons don't always finish last.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw0p9z5a/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Rachel Aaron/Last Dragon Standing/cover.jpg","genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1636982840681,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Rachel Aaron/Last Dragon Standing","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Rachel Aaron/Last Dragon Standing","addedAt":1636982771551,"lastUpdate":1636982840682,"duration":47544400,"size":378225707,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":18,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":1521.604,"title":"001 Rachel Aaron (2018) Last Dragon Standing Heartstrikers Book 5"},{"id":1,"start":1521.604,"end":4877.5380000000005,"title":"002 Rachel Aaron (2018) Last Dragon Standing Heartstrikers Book 5"},{"id":2,"start":4877.5380000000005,"end":6973.372,"title":"003 Rachel Aaron (2018) Last Dragon Standing Heartstrikers Book 5"},{"id":3,"start":6973.372,"end":11209.064,"title":"004 Rachel Aaron (2018) Last Dragon Standing Heartstrikers Book 5"},{"id":4,"start":11209.064,"end":14461.994,"title":"005 Rachel Aaron (2018) Last Dragon Standing Heartstrikers Book 5"},{"id":5,"start":14461.994,"end":16790.91,"title":"006 Rachel Aaron (2018) Last Dragon Standing Heartstrikers Book 5"},{"id":6,"start":16790.91,"end":18895.707,"title":"007 Rachel Aaron (2018) Last Dragon Standing Heartstrikers Book 5"},{"id":7,"start":18895.707,"end":20529.51,"title":"008 Rachel Aaron (2018) Last Dragon Standing Heartstrikers Book 5"},{"id":8,"start":20529.51,"end":23430.519,"title":"009 Rachel Aaron (2018) Last Dragon Standing Heartstrikers Book 5"},{"id":9,"start":23430.519,"end":26231.775,"title":"010 Rachel Aaron (2018) Last Dragon Standing Heartstrikers Book 5"},{"id":10,"start":26231.775,"end":29680.589,"title":"011 Rachel Aaron (2018) Last Dragon Standing Heartstrikers Book 5"},{"id":11,"start":29680.589,"end":32773.673,"title":"012 Rachel Aaron (2018) Last Dragon Standing Heartstrikers Book 5"},{"id":12,"start":32773.673,"end":34949.801,"title":"013 Rachel Aaron (2018) Last Dragon Standing Heartstrikers Book 5"},{"id":13,"start":34949.801,"end":38078.969,"title":"014 Rachel Aaron (2018) Last Dragon Standing Heartstrikers Book 5"},{"id":14,"start":38078.969,"end":40893.784999999996,"title":"015 Rachel Aaron (2018) Last Dragon Standing Heartstrikers Book 5"},{"id":15,"start":40893.784999999996,"end":42974.433,"title":"016 Rachel Aaron (2018) Last Dragon Standing Heartstrikers Book 5"},{"id":16,"start":42974.433,"end":46627.49,"title":"017 Rachel Aaron (2018) Last Dragon Standing Heartstrikers Book 5"},{"id":17,"start":46627.49,"end":47544.4,"title":"018 Rachel Aaron (2018) Last Dragon Standing Heartstrikers Book 5"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0pjylt","ino":"16818967869110205867","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"The Poppy War","subtitle":null,"author":"R.F.

K. Jemisin’s Inheritance Trilogy. When Rin aced the Keju - the Empire-wide test to find the most talented youth to learn at the Academies - it was a shock to everyone: to the test officials, who couldn’t believe a war orphan from Rooster Province could pass without cheating; to Rin’s guardians, who believed they’d finally be able to marry her off and further their criminal enterprise; and to Rin herself, who realized she was finally free of the servitude and despair that had made up her daily existence. That she got into Sinegard - the most elite military school in Nikan - was even more surprising. But surprises aren’t always good. Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the South is not an easy thing at Sinegard. Targeted from the outset by rival classmates for her color, poverty, and gender, Rin discovers she possesses a lethal, unearthly power - an aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. Exploring the depths of her gift with the help of a seemingly insane teacher and psychoactive substances, Rin learns that gods long thought dead are very much alive - and that mastering control over those powers could mean more than just surviving school. For while the Nikara Empire is at peace, the Federation of Mugen still lurks across a narrow sea. The militarily advanced Federation occupied Nikan for decades after the First Poppy War, and only barely lost the continent in the Second. And while most of the people are complacent to go about their lives, a few are aware that a Third Poppy War is just a spark away.... Rin’s shamanic powers may be the only way to save her people. But as she finds out more about the god that has chosen her, the vengeful Phoenix, she fears that winning the war may cost her humanity...and that it may already be too late. R.F. Kuang studies modern Chinese history. She has a BA from Georgetown University and is currently a graduate student in the United Kingdom on a Marshall Scholarship. The Poppy War is her debut novel.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw0pjylt/The Poppy War.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/R.F.

Now fully embedded among the Gold ruling class, Darrow continues his work to bring down Society from within. A life-or-death tale of vengeance with an unforgettable hero at its heart, Golden Son guarantees Pierce Brown's continuing status as one of fiction's most exciting new voices.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw0rp6d6/Pierce Brown -

I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep. You may have heard of me. So begins a tale unequaled in fantasy literature - the story of a hero told in his own voice. It is a tale of sorrow, a tale of survival, a tale of one man’s search for meaning in his universe, and how that search, and the indomitable will that drove it, gave birth to a legend.  Praise for The Kingkiller Chronicle:  “The best epic fantasy I read last year....

McShane, Emily Browning, and Pablo Schreiber. Locked behind bars for three years, Shadow did his time, quietly waiting for the day when he could return to Eagle Point, Indiana. A man no longer scared of what tomorrow might bring, all he wanted was to be with Laura, the wife he deeply loved, and start a new life. But just days before his release, Laura and Shadow's best friend are killed in an accident. With his life in pieces and nothing to keep him tethered, Shadow accepts a job from a beguiling stranger he meets on the way home, an enigmatic man who calls himself Mr. Wednesday. A trickster and a rogue, Wednesday seems to know more about Shadow than Shadow does himself. Life as Wednesday's bodyguard, driver, and errand boy is far more interesting and dangerous than Shadow ever imagined. Soon Shadow learns that the past never dies . . . and that beneath the placid surface of everyday life a storm is brewing—an epic war for the very soul of America—and that he is standing squarely in its path. \"Mystery, satire, sex, horror, poetic prose—American Gods uses all these to keep the reader turning the pages.\"—Washington Post","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw0ualmg/Neil Gaiman - American Gods (10th Anniversary Edition).jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Neil Gaiman/American Gods/Neil Gaiman - American Gods (10th Anniversary Edition).jpg","genres":["Literature & Fiction","Action & Adventure"],"lastUpdate":1636991369162,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Neil Gaiman/American Gods","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Neil Gaiman/American Gods","addedAt":1636991199262,"lastUpdate":1636991369163,"duration":70791482,"size":864996049,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":23,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":699.351,"title":"Neil Gaiman - American Gods 01-23"},{"id":1,"start":699.351,"end":4141.768,"title":"Neil Gaiman - American Gods 02-23"},{"id":2,"start":4141.768,"end":7043.424,"title":"Neil Gaiman - American Gods 03-23"},{"id":3,"start":7043.424,"end":8866.458,"title":"Neil Gaiman - American Gods 04-23"},{"id":4,"start":8866.458,"end":12981.998,"title":"Neil Gaiman - American Gods 05-23"},{"id":5,"start":12981.998,"end":15973.515,"title":"Neil Gaiman - American Gods 06-23"},{"id":6,"start":15973.515,"end":18822.168999999998,"title":"Neil Gaiman - American Gods 07-23"},{"id":7,"start":18822.168999999998,"end":23080.284999999996,"title":"Neil Gaiman - American Gods 08-23"},{"id":8,"start":23080.284999999996,"end":27798.626999999997,"title":"Neil Gaiman - American Gods 09-23"},{"id":9,"start":27798.626999999997,"end":31157.947999999997,"title":"Neil Gaiman - American Gods 10-23"},{"id":10,"start":31157.947999999997,"end":34896.776,"title":"Neil Gaiman - American Gods 11-23"},{"id":11,"start":34896.776,"end":40931.871999999996,"title":"Neil Gaiman - American Gods 12-23"},{"id":12,"start":40931.871999999996,"end":45995.448,"title":"Neil Gaiman - American Gods 13-23"},{"id":13,"start":45995.448,"end":50393.998999999996,"title":"Neil Gaiman - American Gods 14-23"},{"id":14,"start":50393.998999999996,"end":54936.981,"title":"Neil Gaiman - American Gods 15-23"},{"id":15,"start":54936.981,"end":56284.325,"title":"Neil Gaiman - American Gods 16-23"},{"id":16,"start":56284.325,"end":58126.244999999995,"title":"Neil Gaiman - American Gods 17-23"},{"id":17,"start":58126.244999999995,"end":60833.96799999999,"title":"Neil Gaiman - American Gods 18-23"},{"id":18,"start":60833.96799999999,"end":64973.331999999995,"title":"Neil Gaiman - American Gods 19-23"},{"id":19,"start":64973.331999999995,"end":65701.88799999999,"title":"Neil Gaiman - American Gods 20-23"},{"id":20,"start":65701.88799999999,"end":69323.81799999998,"title":"Neil Gaiman - American Gods 21-23"},{"id":21,"start":69323.81799999998,"end":69865.85899999998,"title":"Neil Gaiman - American Gods 22-23"},{"id":22,"start":69865.85899999998,"end":70791.48199999999,"title":"Neil Gaiman - American Gods 23-23"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0x864z","ino":"4986859801016166265","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"When Darkness Falls","subtitle":null,"author":"Mercedes Lackey, James Mallory","authorFL":"Mercedes Lackey, James Mallory","authorLF":"Lackey, Mercedes, Mallory, James","narrator":"Susan Ericksen","series":"Obsidian Trilogy","volumeNumber":"3","publishYear":"2006","publisher":null,"description":"A great working of Wild Magic and High Magic strikes at the heart of the Demon Queen's plots, but the human city, the Golden City of the Bells, falls farther under her sway with each day that passes. And without the City's High Magicians, the Wild Magicians, the Elven Army, and all their allies will surely fall before the onslaught of the Demon Queen's malignant warriors. But not all hope is lost. The Light's young mages, tempered by war, grow ever more powerful. High Mage Cilarnen learns an ancient secret that can make him, for a brief, white-hot time, the greatest mage in the world---unless it kills him. Jermayan, the first Elf-Mage in centuries, has linked with the dragon Ancaladar and rediscovered the swift-as-thought powers of Elven magic, which can reshape mountains and summon lightning from clear skies. Knight-Mage Kellen has molded his troops and the Unicorn Knights into a deadly fighting force. Soon the Elven King and his Commanders put Kellen's magical gifts to their greatest test, in the final battle between the Elves, the humans, and the Demons.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0x864z/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1636996447862,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Mercedes Lackey and James Mallory/Obsidian 03 - When Darkness Falls","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Mercedes Lackey and James Mallory/Obsidian 03 - When Darkness Falls","addedAt":1636996124446,"lastUpdate":1636996447862,"duration":91657143,"size":742887826,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":1,"chapters":[],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0y2cap","ino":"405234283656375608","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Enduring Flame 02","subtitle":"The Phoenix Endangered","author":"Mercedes Lackey and James Mallory","authorFL":"Mercedes Lackey and James Mallory","authorLF":"Mallory, Mercedes Lackey and James","narrator":"William Dufris","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2008","publisher":null,"description":"In The Phoenix Endangered, the second entry in \"The Enduring Flame\", Tiercel, a budding High Mage, and Harrier, a reluctant Knight-Mage, develop greater power - and learn of the evils of war when they see the devastation caused by the fanatical armies of the Wild Mage Bisochim.

That world proved so popular with the creators and readers alike that Lackey and Mallory have returned to it again, with The Phoenix Unchained, Book One of The Enduring Flame, the opening volume of a new epic fantasy trilogy. After 1,000 years of peace, much magick has faded from the world. The Elves live far from humankind. There are no High Mages, and Wild Mages are seen only rarely. Bisochim, a powerful Wild Mage, is determined to reintroduce Darkness to the world, believing that it is out of balance. Tiercel, a young Armethalian nobleman, is convinced that High Magick is not just philosophy. He attempts a spell and draws the unwelcome attention of Bisochim. Tiercel survives Bisochim's attack and begins trying to turn himself into a High Mage.

In the ice, east of the Black Rock, there is a hole into which broken children are thrown. Yaz's people call it the Pit of the Missing, and now it is drawing her in as she has always known it would. To resist the cold, to endure the months of night when even the air itself begins to freeze, requires a special breed. Variation is dangerous, difference is fatal. And Yaz is not the same. Yaz's difference tears her from the only life she's ever known, away from her family, from the boy she thought she would spend her days with, and has to carve out a new path for herself in a world whose existence she never suspected. A world full of difference and mystery and danger. Yaz learns that Abeth is older and stranger than she had ever imagined. She learns that her weaknesses are another kind of strength and that the cruel arithmetic of survival that has always governed her people can be challenged.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw10l94h/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637002026065,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Mark Lawrence/The Girl and the Stars","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Mark Lawrence/The Girl and the Stars","addedAt":1637001774405,"lastUpdate":1637002026065,"duration":66117705,"size":1053923891,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":42,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":15.0,"title":"Chapter 0 (Opening Credits)"},{"id":1,"start":15.0,"end":276.0,"title":"Chapter 1 (Prologue)"},{"id":2,"start":276.0,"end":3207.0,"title":"Chapter 2 (Chapter 1)"},{"id":3,"start":3207.0,"end":3888.0,"title":"Chapter 3 (Chapter 2)"},{"id":4,"start":3888.0,"end":4844.0,"title":"Chapter 4 (Chapter 3)"},{"id":5,"start":4844.0,"end":6327.0,"title":"Chapter 5 (Chapter 4)"},{"id":6,"start":6327.0,"end":8166.0,"title":"Chapter 6 (Chapter 5)"},{"id":7,"start":8166.0,"end":10843.0,"title":"Chapter 7 (Chapter 6)"},{"id":8,"start":10843.0,"end":12169.0,"title":"Chapter 8 (Chapter 7)"},{"id":9,"start":12169.0,"end":13642.0,"title":"Chapter 9 (Chapter 8)"},{"id":10,"start":13642.0,"end":17393.0,"title":"Chapter 10 (Chapter 9)"},{"id":11,"start":17393.0,"end":18840.0,"title":"Chapter 11 (Chapter 10)"},{"id":12,"start":18840.0,"end":20232.0,"title":"Chapter 12 (Chapter 11)"},{"id":13,"start":20232.0,"end":22176.996009,"title":"Chapter 13 (Chapter 12)"},{"id":14,"start":22176.996009,"end":24392.996009,"title":"Chapter 14 (Chapter 13)"},{"id":15,"start":24392.996009,"end":25685.996009,"title":"Chapter 15 (Chapter 14)"},{"id":16,"start":25685.996009,"end":27420.996009,"title":"Chapter 16 (Chapter 15)"},{"id":17,"start":27420.996009,"end":30412.996009,"title":"Chapter 17 (Chapter 16)"},{"id":18,"start":30412.996009,"end":31669.996009,"title":"Chapter 18 (Chapter 17)"},{"id":19,"start":31669.996009,"end":32263.996009,"title":"Chapter 19 (Chapter 18)"},{"id":20,"start":32263.996009,"end":33502.996008999995,"title":"Chapter 20 (Chapter 19)"},{"id":21,"start":33502.996008999995,"end":34157.996008999995,"title":"Chapter 21 (Chapter 20)"},{"id":22,"start":34157.996008999995,"end":36153.996008999995,"title":"Chapter 22 (Chapter 21)"},{"id":23,"start":36153.996008999995,"end":37807.996008999995,"title":"Chapter 23 (Chapter 22)"},{"id":24,"start":37807.996008999995,"end":39138.996008999995,"title":"Chapter 24 (Chapter 23)"},{"id":25,"start":39138.996008999995,"end":40444.97900199999,"title":"Chapter 25 (Chapter 24)"},{"id":26,"start":40444.97900199999,"end":41815.97900199999,"title":"Chapter 26 (Chapter 25)"},{"id":27,"start":41815.97900199999,"end":45182.97900199999,"title":"Chapter 27 (Chapter 26)"},{"id":28,"start":45182.97900199999,"end":47149.97900199999,"title":"Chapter 28 (Chapter 27)"},{"id":29,"start":47149.97900199999,"end":48104.97900199999,"title":"Chapter 29 (Chapter 28)"},{"id":30,"start":48104.97900199999,"end":49878.97900199999,"title":"Chapter 30 (Chapter 29)"},{"id":31,"start":49878.97900199999,"end":51467.97900199999,"title":"Chapter 31 (Chapter 30)"},{"id":32,"start":51467.97900199999,"end":52940.97900199999,"title":"Chapter 32 (Chapter 31)"},{"id":33,"start":52940.97900199999,"end":54320.97900199999,"title":"Chapter 33 (Chapter 32)"},{"id":34,"start":54320.97900199999,"end":56234.97900199999,"title":"Chapter 34 (Chapter 33)"},{"id":35,"start":56234.97900199999,"end":57013.97900199999,"title":"Chapter 35 (Chapter 34)"},{"id":36,"start":57013.97900199999,"end":58181.97900199999,"title":"Chapter 36 (Chapter 35)"},{"id":37,"start":58181.97900199999,"end":60160.97900199999,"title":"Chapter 37 (Chapter 36)"},{"id":38,"start":60160.97900199999,"end":61518.97900199999,"title":"Chapter 38 (Chapter 37)"},{"id":39,"start":61518.97900199999,"end":64519.97900199999,"title":"Chapter 39 (Chapter 38)"},{"id":40,"start":64519.97900199999,"end":66063.979002,"title":"Chapter 40 (Chapter 39)"},{"id":41,"start":66063.979002,"end":66093.979002,"title":"Chapter 41 (End Credits)"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw10qny9","ino":"11640290699127130973","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"The Girl and the Mountain","subtitle":null,"author":"Mark Lawrence","authorFL":"Mark Lawrence","authorLF":"Lawrence, Mark","narrator":"Helen Duff","series":"The Book of the Ice","volumeNumber":"2","publishYear":"2021","publisher":null,"description":"The second novel in the thrilling and epic new fantasy series from the international best-selling author of Red Sister and Prince of Thorns. On the planet Abeth there is only the ice. And the Black Rock.  For generations the priests of the Black Rock have reached out from their mountain to steer the fate of the ice tribes. With their Hidden God, their magic and their iron, the priests’ rule has never been questioned. But when ice triber Yaz challenged their authority, she was torn away from the only life she had ever known, and forced to find a new path for herself.  Yaz has lost her friends and found her enemies. She has a mountain to climb, and even if she can break the Hidden God’s power, her dream of a green world lies impossibly far to the south, across a vast emptiness of ice.

Mark is an excellent writer.” - George R.R. Martin In January 1986, fifteen-year-old boy-genius Nick Hayes discovers he’s dying. And it isn’t even the strangest thing to happen to him that week. Nick and his Dungeons & Dragons-playing friends are used to living in their imaginations. But when a new girl, Mia, joins the group and reality becomes weirder than the fantasy world they visit in their weekly games, none of them are prepared for what comes next. A strange - yet curiously familiar - man is following Nick, with abilities that just shouldn’t exist. And this man bears a cryptic message: Mia’s in grave danger, though she doesn’t know it yet. She needs Nick’s help - now. He finds himself in a race against time to unravel an impossible mystery and save the girl. And all that stands in his way is a probably terminal disease, a knife-wielding maniac and the laws of physics. Challenge accepted. Ready Player One meets Stranger Things in this new novel by bestselling author Mark Lawrence.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1139df/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Romance","Science Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637002710820,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Mark Lawrence/One Word Kill","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Mark Lawrence/One Word Kill","addedAt":1637002613581,"lastUpdate":1637002710821,"duration":24292960,"size":195463282,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":25,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":32.0,"title":"Chapter 0 (Opening Credits)"},{"id":1,"start":32.0,"end":983.0,"title":"Chapter 1 (Chapter 1)"},{"id":2,"start":983.0,"end":2676.0,"title":"Chapter 2 (Chapter 2)"},{"id":3,"start":2676.0,"end":4490.0,"title":"Chapter 3 (Chapter 3)"},{"id":4,"start":4490.0,"end":5775.0,"title":"Chapter 4 (Chapter 4)"},{"id":5,"start":5775.0,"end":6856.0,"title":"Chapter 5 (Chapter 5)"},{"id":6,"start":6856.0,"end":7745.0,"title":"Chapter 6 (Chapter 6)"},{"id":7,"start":7745.0,"end":8430.0,"title":"Chapter 7 (Chapter 7)"},{"id":8,"start":8430.0,"end":9398.0,"title":"Chapter 8 (Chapter 8)"},{"id":9,"start":9398.0,"end":10268.0,"title":"Chapter 9 (Chapter 9)"},{"id":10,"start":10268.0,"end":11170.0,"title":"Chapter 10 (Chapter 10)"},{"id":11,"start":11170.0,"end":11941.0,"title":"Chapter 11 (Chapter 11)"},{"id":12,"start":11941.0,"end":12695.0,"title":"Chapter 12 (Chapter 12)"},{"id":13,"start":12695.0,"end":13472.0,"title":"Chapter 13 (Chapter 13)"},{"id":14,"start":13472.0,"end":14247.0,"title":"Chapter 14 (Chapter 14)"},{"id":15,"start":14247.0,"end":15382.0,"title":"Chapter 15 (Chapter 15)"},{"id":16,"start":15382.0,"end":16392.0,"title":"Chapter 16 (Chapter 16)"},{"id":17,"start":16392.0,"end":17555.0,"title":"Chapter 17 (Chapter 17)"},{"id":18,"start":17555.0,"end":18124.0,"title":"Chapter 18 (Chapter 18)"},{"id":19,"start":18124.0,"end":19365.0,"title":"Chapter 19 (Chapter 19)"},{"id":20,"start":19365.0,"end":20217.0,"title":"Chapter 20 (Chapter 20)"},{"id":21,"start":20217.0,"end":22234.0,"title":"Chapter 21 (Chapter 21)"},{"id":22,"start":22234.0,"end":23505.0,"title":"Chapter 22 (Chapter 22)"},{"id":23,"start":23505.0,"end":24221.0,"title":"Chapter 23 (Chapter 23)"},{"id":24,"start":24221.0,"end":24286.0,"title":"Chapter 24 (End Credits)"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw11cqy1","ino":"17950685573609012963","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Holy Sister","subtitle":null,"author":"Mark Lawrence","authorFL":"Mark Lawrence","authorLF":"Lawrence, Mark","narrator":"Heather O'Neill","series":"Books of the Ancestor","volumeNumber":"3","publishYear":"2019","publisher":null,"description":"The third book in the thrilling and epic Book of the Ancestor trilogy from international best-selling author Mark Lawrence.

For hundreds of years, the fighters of the Kusanagi Peninsula have held the Empire's enemies at bay, earning their frozen spit of land the name \"The Sword of Kaigen\". Born into Kusanagi's legendary Matsuda family, f14-year-old Mamoru has always known his purpose: To master his family's fighting techniques and defend his homeland. But when an outsider arrives and pulls back the curtain on Kaigen's alleged age of peace, Mamoru realizes that he might not have much time to become the fighter he was bred to be. Worse, the empire he was bred to defend may stand on a foundation of lies. Misaki told herself that she left the passions of her youth behind when she married into the Matsuda house. Determined to be a good housewife and mother, she hid away her sword, along with everything from her days as a fighter in a faraway country. But with her growing son asking questions about the outside world, the threat of an impending invasion looming across the sea, and her frigid husband grating on her nerves, Misaki finds the fighter in her clawing its way back to the surface. When the winds of war reach their peninsula, will the Matsuda family have the strength to defend their empire? Or will they tear each other apart before the true enemies even reach their shores?","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw129hq9/M. L.

The youngest, half-goblin son of the Emperor has lived his entire life in exile, distant from the Imperial Court and the deadly intrigue that suffuses it. But when his father and three sons in line for the throne are killed in an \"accident\", he has no choice but to take his place as the only surviving rightful heir. Entirely unschooled in the art of court politics, he has no friends, no advisors, and the sure knowledge that whoever assassinated his father and brothers could make an attempt on his life at any moment. Surrounded by sycophants eager to curry favor with the naïve new emperor, and overwhelmed by the burdens of his new life, he can trust nobody. Amid the swirl of plots to depose him, offers of arranged marriages, and the specter of the unknown conspirators who lurk in the shadows, he must quickly adjust to life as the Goblin Emperor. All the while, he is alone, and trying to find even a single friend...and hoping for the possibility of romance, yet also vigilant against the unseen enemies that threaten him, lest he lose his throne - or his life. Katherine Addison's The Goblin Emperor is an exciting fantasy novel, set against the pageantry and color of a fascinating, unique world.

No one's tried to kill Harry Dresden for almost an entire year, and his life finally seems to be calming down. For once, the future looks fairly bright. But the past casts one hell of a long shadow. An old bargain has placed Harry in debt to Mab, monarch of the Winter Court of the Sidhe, the Queen of Air and Darkness - and she's calling in her marker. It's a small favor he can't refuse, one that will trap Harry Dresden between a nightmarish foe and an equally deadly ally, and one that will strain his skills-and loyalties-to their very limits.

But when Tavi and his legions guide the Canim safely to their lands, his worst fears are realized.  The dreaded Vord - the enemy of Aleran and Cane alike - have spent the last three years laying waste to the Canim homeland. And when the Alerans are cut off from their ships, they find themselves with no choice but to fight shoulder to shoulder if they are to survive.  For 1,000 years, Alera and her furies have withstood every enemy and survived every foe.

Meanwhile, young Tavi of Calderon joins a newly formed legion under an assumed name even as the ruthless Kalare unites with the Canim, bestial enemies of the realm whose vast numbers spell certain doom for Alera. When treachery from within destroys the army's command structure, Tavi finds himself leading an inexperienced, poorly equipped legion - the only force standing between the Canim horde and the war-torn realm.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1ahmgp/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637041706108,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Jim Butcher/Codex Alera 03 -

Aiding the Imperials are renegade Mechanics and Mages still loyal to the old Guilds or employed by the Empire. But before they can launch an all-out war, the Imperials must eliminate a major threat: Kira, daughter of Master Mechanic Mari and Master of Mages Alain. Kidnapped and imprisoned, Kira has to escape and avoid recapture as the full might of the Empire is aimed at her. Her only hope lies in the skills she has mastered; her indomitable spirit; and the unfailing aid of Jason, her boyfriend from the distant world of Urth. With the Imperial legions closing in and thousands of lives riding on her efforts, Kira has to use every weapon available to her, including special abilities she has kept secret until now - abilities that may prove to be as dangerous as the enemy forces. Mari and Alain must come to Kira's aid and work to create an alliance against the Empire. If they fail, a deadlier new war will erupt, with every soldier carrying a rifle instead of a sword or crossbow - and the Peace of the Daughter will end in a bloodbath.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw1d0qbt/Blood of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 2.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Jack Campbell/Blood of Dragons/Blood of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 2.jpg","genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637042116449,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Jack Campbell/Blood of Dragons","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Jack Campbell/Blood of Dragons","addedAt":1637022651641,"lastUpdate":1637042116449,"duration":45638391,"size":371004741,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":17,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":3013.255,"title":"Blood of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 2 - 01"},{"id":1,"start":3013.255,"end":5635.902,"title":"Blood of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 2 - 02"},{"id":2,"start":5635.902,"end":8376.74,"title":"Blood of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 2 - 03"},{"id":3,"start":8376.74,"end":11127.004,"title":"Blood of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 2 - 04"},{"id":4,"start":11127.004,"end":13220.516000000001,"title":"Blood of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 2 - 05"},{"id":5,"start":13220.516000000001,"end":15784.324,"title":"Blood of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 2 - 06"},{"id":6,"start":15784.324,"end":18749.838,"title":"Blood of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 2 - 07"},{"id":7,"start":18749.838,"end":21463.322,"title":"Blood of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 2 - 08"},{"id":8,"start":21463.322,"end":24471.515,"title":"Blood of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 2 - 09"},{"id":9,"start":24471.515,"end":26555.134,"title":"Blood of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 2 - 10"},{"id":10,"start":26555.134,"end":29155.119,"title":"Blood of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 2 - 11"},{"id":11,"start":29155.119,"end":32315.959,"title":"Blood of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 2 - 12"},{"id":12,"start":32315.959,"end":34260.816999999995,"title":"Blood of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 2 - 13"},{"id":13,"start":34260.816999999995,"end":36799.361999999994,"title":"Blood of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 2 - 14"},{"id":14,"start":36799.361999999994,"end":38377.437999999995,"title":"Blood of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 2 - 15"},{"id":15,"start":38377.437999999995,"end":43014.649,"title":"Blood of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 2 - 16"},{"id":16,"start":43014.649,"end":45638.390999999996,"title":"Blood of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 2 - 17"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1dl21o","ino":"16554930531750803809","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"The Two Towers (Phil Dragash)","subtitle":null,"author":"J.R.R.

Tolkien created to provide \"the necessary background of history for Elvish tongues\". From these academic aspirations was born one of the most popular and imaginative works in English literature. The Fellowship of the Ring, the first volume in the trilogy, tells of the fateful power of the One Ring.

Soon after the Dutch scientist and clockmaker Christiaan Huygens invented the very first Clakker in the seventeenth century, the Netherlands built a whole mechanical army. It wasn't long before a legion of clockwork fusiliers marched on Westminster, and the Netherlands became the world's sole superpower. Three centuries later it still is. Only the French still fiercely defend their belief in universal human rights for all men - flesh and brass alike. After decades of warfare, the Dutch and French have reached a tenuous cease-fire in a conflict that has ravaged North America. But one audacious Clakker, Jax, can no longer bear the bonds of his slavery. He will make a bid for freedom, and the consequences of his escape will shake the very foundations of the Brasswork Throne.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1fp6q6/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637027242239,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Ian Tregillis/The Mechanical","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Ian Tregillis/The Mechanical","addedAt":1637027152170,"lastUpdate":1637027242239,"duration":56745250,"size":462248672,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":21,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":3069.991,"title":"The Mechanical The Alchemy Wars (Unabridged) - 001"},{"id":1,"start":3069.991,"end":5839.5740000000005,"title":"The Mechanical The Alchemy Wars (Unabridged) - 002"},{"id":2,"start":5839.5740000000005,"end":8292.187,"title":"The Mechanical The Alchemy Wars (Unabridged) - 003"},{"id":3,"start":8292.187,"end":12701.842,"title":"The Mechanical The Alchemy Wars (Unabridged) - 004"},{"id":4,"start":12701.842,"end":16062.968,"title":"The Mechanical The Alchemy Wars (Unabridged) - 005"},{"id":5,"start":16062.968,"end":18570.856,"title":"The Mechanical The Alchemy Wars (Unabridged) - 006"},{"id":6,"start":18570.856,"end":21213.693,"title":"The Mechanical The Alchemy Wars (Unabridged) - 007"},{"id":7,"start":21213.693,"end":23084.977,"title":"The Mechanical The Alchemy Wars (Unabridged) - 008"},{"id":8,"start":23084.977,"end":26079.082,"title":"The Mechanical The Alchemy Wars (Unabridged) - 009"},{"id":9,"start":26079.082,"end":26141.909,"title":"The Mechanical The Alchemy Wars (Unabridged) - 010"},{"id":10,"start":26141.909,"end":28483.45,"title":"The Mechanical The Alchemy Wars (Unabridged) - 011"},{"id":11,"start":28483.45,"end":32503.149,"title":"The Mechanical The Alchemy Wars (Unabridged) - 012"},{"id":12,"start":32503.149,"end":34434.907,"title":"The Mechanical The Alchemy Wars (Unabridged) - 013"},{"id":13,"start":34434.907,"end":38581.509,"title":"The Mechanical The Alchemy Wars (Unabridged) - 014"},{"id":14,"start":38581.509,"end":40500.911,"title":"The Mechanical The Alchemy Wars (Unabridged) - 015"},{"id":15,"start":40500.911,"end":42971.235,"title":"The Mechanical The Alchemy Wars (Unabridged) - 016"},{"id":16,"start":42971.235,"end":44876.714,"title":"The Mechanical The Alchemy Wars (Unabridged) - 017"},{"id":17,"start":44876.714,"end":47931.006,"title":"The Mechanical The Alchemy Wars (Unabridged) - 018"},{"id":18,"start":47931.006,"end":51186.205,"title":"The Mechanical The Alchemy Wars (Unabridged) - 019"},{"id":19,"start":51186.205,"end":55392.549,"title":"The Mechanical The Alchemy Wars (Unabridged) - 020"},{"id":20,"start":55392.549,"end":56745.25,"title":"The Mechanical The Alchemy Wars (Unabridged) - 021"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1fvum4","ino":"12368425945462192547","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"The Queen of Nothing","subtitle":null,"author":"Holly Black","authorFL":"Holly Black","authorLF":"Black, Holly","narrator":"Caitlin Kelly","series":"The Folk of the Air","volumeNumber":"3","publishYear":"2019","publisher":null,"description":"A powerful curse forces the exiled Queen of Faerie to choose between ambition and humanity in this highly anticipated and jaw-dropping finale to the Folk of the Air trilogy from a number one New York Times best-selling author.

Jude learned this lesson when she released her control over the wicked king, Cardan, in exchange for immeasurable power. Now as the exiled mortal Queen of Faerie, Jude is powerless and left reeling from Cardan's betrayal. She bides her time, determined to reclaim everything he took from her. Opportunity arrives in the form of her twin sister, Taryn, whose mortal life is in peril. Jude must risk venturing back into the treacherous Faerie Court, and confront her lingering feelings for Cardan, if she wishes to save her sister. But Elfhame is not as she left it. War is brewing.

Patricia Campbell's life has never felt smaller. Her ambitious husband is too busy to give her a goodbye kiss in the morning, her kids have their own lives, her senile mother-in-law needs constant care, and she's always a step behind on thank-you notes and her endless list of chores. The one thing she has to look forward to is her book club, a close-knit group of Charleston women united by their love of true crime and paperback fiction. At these meetings they're as likely to talk about the Manson family as they are marriage, motherhood, and neighborhood gossip. This predictable pattern is upended when Patricia meets James Harris, a handsome stranger who moves into the neighborhood to take care of his elderly aunt and ends up joining the book club. James is sensitive and well-read, and he makes Patricia feel things she hasn't felt in 20 years. But there's something off about him. He doesn't have a bank account, he doesn't like going out during the day, and Patricia's mother-in-law insists that she knew him when she was a girl, an impossibility. When local children go missing, Patricia and the book club members start to suspect James is more of a Bundy than a Beatnik, but no one outside of the book club believes them. Have they read too many true crime books, or have they invited a real monster into their homes?","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1grxio/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Horror"],"lastUpdate":1637029245430,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Grady Hendrix/The Southern Book Club's Guid to Slaying Vampires","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Grady Hendrix/The Southern Book Club's Guid to Slaying Vampires","addedAt":1637028959657,"lastUpdate":1637029245430,"duration":49754954,"size":305248897,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":46,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":13.793,"title":"The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires -

Family is duty. Magic is power. Honor is everything. Jade is the lifeblood of the island of Kekon. It has been mined, traded, stolen, and killed for - and for centuries, honorable Green Bone warriors like the Kaul family have used it to enhance their magical abilities and defend the island from foreign invasion. Now, the war is over and a new generation of Kauls vies for control of Kekon's bustling capital city. They care about nothing but protecting their own, cornering the jade market, and defending the districts under their protection. Ancient tradition has little place in this rapidly changing nation. When a powerful new drug emerges that lets anyone - even foreigners - wield jade, the simmering tension between the Kauls and the rival Ayt family erupts into open violence. The outcome of this clan war will determine the fate of all Green Bones - from their grandest patriarch to the lowliest motorcycle runner on the streets - and of Kekon itself. Jade City begins an epic tale of family, honor, and those who live and die by the ancient laws of jade and blood.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw1kdyrh/Green Bone Saga 1 - Jade City.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Fonda Lee/Jade City/Green Bone Saga 1 -

Following an unthinkable path, he will strive to become the greatest swordsman to ever live, willing to die a hundred thousand times for the chance to kill three of his own people.   The Rage of Dragons launches an unmissable epic fantasy series about a world caught in an endless war and the young man who will become his people's only hope for survival.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1khm56/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637035257308,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Evan Winter/The Rage of Dragons","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Evan Winter/The Rage of Dragons","addedAt":1637035196412,"lastUpdate":1637035257308,"duration":58528335,"size":447895190,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":18,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":2546.88775,"title":"01 - Track 1"},{"id":1,"start":2546.88775,"end":6272.394249999999,"title":"02 - Track 2"},{"id":2,"start":6272.394249999999,"end":10746.909749999999,"title":"03 - Track 3"},{"id":3,"start":10746.909749999999,"end":14362.492999999999,"title":"04 - Track 4"},{"id":4,"start":14362.492999999999,"end":17617.769249999998,"title":"05 - Track 5"},{"id":5,"start":17617.769249999998,"end":21085.133749999997,"title":"06 - Track 6"},{"id":6,"start":21085.133749999997,"end":24955.17575,"title":"07 - Track 7"},{"id":7,"start":24955.17575,"end":29981.397249999998,"title":"08 - Track 8"},{"id":8,"start":29981.397249999998,"end":34004.778,"title":"09 - Track 9"},{"id":9,"start":34004.778,"end":37074.53275,"title":"10 - Track 10"},{"id":10,"start":37074.53275,"end":39521.475999999995,"title":"11 - Track 11"},{"id":11,"start":39521.475999999995,"end":42589.950749999996,"title":"12 - Track 12"},{"id":12,"start":42589.950749999996,"end":44853.51424999999,"title":"13 - Track 13"},{"id":13,"start":44853.51424999999,"end":46729.446874999994,"title":"14 - Track 14"},{"id":14,"start":46729.446874999994,"end":50292.62837499999,"title":"15 - Track 15"},{"id":15,"start":50292.62837499999,"end":53929.84112499999,"title":"16 - Track 16"},{"id":16,"start":53929.84112499999,"end":57825.09137499999,"title":"17 - Track 17"},{"id":17,"start":57825.09137499999,"end":58528.334937999985,"title":"18 - Track 18"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1la6bj","ino":"15429684165937018969","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"First Strike","subtitle":null,"author":"Eric Nylund","authorFL":"Eric Nylund","authorLF":"Nylund, Eric","narrator":"Todd McLaren","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2004","publisher":null,"description":"The New York Times best-selling aftermath of Halo: Combat Evolved featuring the Master Chief - part of the expanded universe based on the award-winning video game series!

Together with his AI companion Cortana and the last remaining Spartans, the galaxy-spanning fight rages on two fronts following the destruction of the human military stronghold Reach by Covenant forces and the mysterious artificial ringworld known as “Halo” at the hands of the Master Chief. One faction - a squad of Spartans lead by Blue Team’s Fred-104 and Kelly-087 - is trapped on the glassed surface of Reach, the only planet they’ve ever known as home.

As the city prepares to celebrate Queen Victoria's golden jubilee, Veronica Speedwell is marking a milestone of her own. After burying her spinster aunt, the orphaned Veronica is free to resume her world travels in pursuit of scientific inquiry - and the occasional romantic dalliance. As familiar with hunting butterflies as she is fending off admirers, Veronica wields her butterfly net and a sharpened hatpin with equal aplomb, and with her last connection to England now gone, she intends to embark upon the journey of a lifetime. But fate has other plans, as Veronica discovers when she thwarts her own abduction with the help of an enigmatic German baron with ties to her mysterious past.

Three hundred years after the events of the Mistborn trilogy, Scadrial is now on the verge of modernity, with railroads to supplement the canals, electric lighting in the streets and the homes of the wealthy, and the first steel-framed skyscrapers racing for the clouds. The Bands of Mourning are the mythical metal minds owned by the Lord Ruler, said to grant anyone who wears them the powers that the Lord Ruler had at his command. Hardly anyone thinks they really exist. A kandra researcher has returned to Elendel with images that seem to depict the Bands, as well as writings in a language that no one can read. Waxillium Ladrian is recruited to travel south to the city of New Seran to investigate. Along the way he discovers hints that point to the true goals of his uncle Edwarn and the shadowy organization known as The Set.

When the great red star Calamity appeared in the sky, some believed the end had come. They were right. Calamity created the Epics: humans with incredible powers they didn't deserve. They could have saved mankind. They could have lifted us into harmony and prosperity. Instead they burned. They slaughtered. They conquered. And then they ruled. Jax has learned all of this the hard way. Orphaned at an early age, he's spent most of his childhood training to be a Reckoner - determined to find the Epics' weaknesses, unlock their secrets, and protect those of us who are still left. But now, the mysterious High Epic Lifeforce has arrived with his flying city, Lux, to plunder what's left of Texas. So Jax and his ragtag team - the few who remain of the once-mighty Texas Reckoners - must take their battle to this floating fortress of riches - and defeat the invincible. To avenge what has been lost. And rise anew.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1vvch0/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Science

Critically acclaimed and best-selling authors Becky Albertalli and Adam Silvera combine their talents in this smart, funny, heartfelt collaboration about two very different boys who can’t decide if the universe is pushing them together - or pulling them apart. Arthur is only in New York for the summer, but if Broadway has taught him anything, it’s that the universe can deliver a showstopping romance when you least expect it. Ben thinks the universe needs to mind its business. If the universe had his back, he wouldn’t be on his way to the post office carrying a box of his ex-boyfriend’s things. But when Arthur and Ben meet-cute at the post office, what exactly does the universe have in store for them? Maybe nothing. After all, they get separated. Maybe everything. After all, they get reunited. But what if they can’t nail a first date even after three do-overs? What if Arthur tries too hard to make it work and Ben doesn’t try hard enough? What if life really isn’t like a Broadway play? But what if it is?

Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. Now, he's sure he'll be the first person to die there. After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive - and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. Chances are, though, he won't have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain old \"human error\" are much more likely to kill him first. But Mark isn't ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills - and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit - he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him? Wil Wheaton, who has lent his voice to sci-fi blockbusters like Ready Player One and Redshirts, breathes new life (and plenty of sarcasm) into the iconic character of Mark Watney, making this edition a must-listen for both longtime fans of The Martian and new listeners alike. BONUS MATERIAL: This edition includes the following extras: “Diary of an AssCan” - Mark Watney, new astronaut “I Made It!” - A happy letter to Mom “Car Trouble” - A somewhat sad letter to Mom “The Earthling” - A postscript. *Available for the first time in this recording","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1zphvp/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction &

Scott Bakker's magnificent debut, drew thunderous acclaim from reviewers and fellow fantasy authors. Listeners were invited into a darkly threatening, thrillingly imaginative universe as fully realized as that of any in modern fantasy and introduced to one of the genre's great characters: the powerful warrior-philosopher Anasrimbor Kelhus, on whom the fate of a violently apocalyptic Holy War rests. Bakker's follow-up to The Darkness that Comes Before, The Warrior Prophet enticed readers further into the richly imagined world of myth, violence, and sorcery. The startling and far-reaching answers to these questions are brought into thrilling focus in The Thousandfold Thought, the conclusion to The Prince of Nothing trilogy. Casting into question all the action that has taken place before, twisting listeners' intuitions in unforeseen directions, and remolding the fantasy genre to broaden the scope of intricacy and meaning, R. Scott Bakker has once again written a fantasy novel that defies all expectations and rewards the listener with an experience unlike any to be had in the canon of fantasy literature.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw215cum/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637063278258,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"R Scott Bakker/Prince Of Nothing/03 The Thousandfold Thought","fullPath":"/audiobooks/R Scott Bakker/Prince Of Nothing/03 The Thousandfold Thought","addedAt":1637063178419,"lastUpdate":1637063278258,"duration":59423014,"size":726262294,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":16,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":7405.166,"title":"The Thousandfold Thought 01"},{"id":1,"start":7405.166,"end":9848.007,"title":"The Thousandfold Thought 02"},{"id":2,"start":9848.007,"end":13686.884,"title":"The Thousandfold Thought 03"},{"id":3,"start":13686.884,"end":16967.942,"title":"The Thousandfold Thought 04"},{"id":4,"start":16967.942,"end":20964.05,"title":"The Thousandfold Thought 05"},{"id":5,"start":20964.05,"end":24522.947,"title":"The Thousandfold Thought 06"},{"id":6,"start":24522.947,"end":25964.645,"title":"The Thousandfold Thought 07"},{"id":7,"start":25964.645,"end":28652.776,"title":"The Thousandfold Thought 08"},{"id":8,"start":28652.776,"end":31306.687,"title":"The Thousandfold Thought 09"},{"id":9,"start":31306.687,"end":34644.562000000005,"title":"The Thousandfold Thought 10"},{"id":10,"start":34644.562000000005,"end":37548.98700000001,"title":"The Thousandfold Thought 11"},{"id":11,"start":37548.98700000001,"end":40682.95000000001,"title":"The Thousandfold Thought 12"},{"id":12,"start":40682.95000000001,"end":43760.82800000001,"title":"The Thousandfold Thought 13"},{"id":13,"start":43760.82800000001,"end":46386.37000000001,"title":"The Thousandfold Thought 14"},{"id":14,"start":46386.37000000001,"end":51878.79800000001,"title":"The Thousandfold Thought 15"},{"id":15,"start":51878.79800000001,"end":59423.01400000001,"title":"The Thousandfold Thought 16"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw21nwvl","ino":"8310594114075472854","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"01","subtitle":"Across the Nightingale Floor","author":"Lian Hearn","authorFL":"Lian Hearn","authorLF":"Hearn, Lian","narrator":"Aiko Nakasone; Kevin Gray","series":"Tales of Otori","volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2003","publisher":null,"description":"In his palace at Inuyama, Lord Iida Sadamu, warlord of the Tohan clan, surveys his famous nightingale floor.

spectacular conclusion in The Light of All That Falls, the final chapter of the Licanius Trilogy by acclaimed epic fantasy author James Islington. After a savage battle, the Boundary is whole again - but it may be too late. Banes now stalk the lands of Andarra, and the Venerate have gathered their armies for a final, crushing blow.  In Ilin Illan, Wirr fights to maintain a precarious alliance between Andarra's factions of power. With dark forces closing in on the capital, if he cannot succeed, the war is lost. Imprisoned and alone in a strange land, Davian is pitted against the remaining Venerate. As he tries to keep them from undoing Asha's sacrifice, he struggles to come to terms with his own path and all he has learned about Caeden, the friend he chose to set free. And finally, Caeden is confronted with the reality of a plan laid centuries ago - heartbroken at how it started and devastated by how it must end.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw24jy44/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction &

Before that, Garion had been a simple farm boy. Afterward, he discovered he's a sorcerer. Now, at last, the Orb has been regained and the quest nears its end. Of course, the questors must still escape from a crumbling enemy fortress, flee across a desert filled with Murgo soldiers, and avoid the Grolim Hierarchs seeking to destroy them with dark magic. After that, Garion feels assured his part will be finished. But the prophecy still holds several surprises for Garion, and for the Imperial Princess Ce'Nedra.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw25e4ky/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637070563372,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"David Eddings/The Belgariad/04 -

Gavin's powers are fading and his end draws near as war rages across the satrapies in the second novel novel of the NYT best-selling Lightbringer series by Brent Week. Gavin Guile is dying.  He'd thought he had five years left - now he has less than one. With 50,000 refugees, a bastard son, and an ex-fiancée who may have learned his darkest secret, Gavin has problems on every side. All magic in the world is running wild and threatens to destroy the Seven Satrapies. Worst of all, the old gods are being reborn, and their army of color wights is unstoppable. The only salvation may be the brother whose freedom and life Gavin stole 16 years ago.  *Booktrack is an immersive format that pairs traditional audiobook narration to complementary music. The tempo and rhythm of the score are in perfect harmony with the action and characters throughout the audiobook. Gently playing in the background, the music never overpowers or distracts from the narration, so listeners can enjoy every minute. When you purchase this Booktrack edition, you receive the exact narration as the traditional audiobook available, with the addition of music throughout.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw27yx4q/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction &

The Wizard's Guild has been shattered by a coup, and in the uproar Geralt was seriously injured. The witcher is supposed to be a guardian of the innocent, a protector of those in need, a defender against powerful and dangerous monsters that prey on men in dark times. But now that dark times have fallen upon the world, Geralt is helpless until he has recovered from his injuries. While war rages across all of the lands, the future of magic is under threat, and those sorcerers who survive are determined to protect it. It's an impossible situation in which to find one girl - Ciri, the heiress to the throne of Cintra, has vanished - until a rumor places her in the Niflgaard court, preparing to marry the emperor.

More and more, my past self’s hold on me lessened, allowing me to become the person I wanted to be in this world. But at this moment, I found myself wishing to turn back to the old me - to the cold, rational me that had suppressed his emotions in exchange for having no vulnerability that could be used against him. Arthur Leywin knew well the cold terror of war. Yet, in his past life as King Grey, he had never lost a friend, mentor, or loved one; he had none to lose. Now, though, Arthur must accept that even those closest to him must take up arms to defend their homes as the enemy force seeks new methods to strike at the heart of Dicathen.  In his quest to stop the approaching army, Arthur must travel to the dwarven kingdom of Darv, gain mastery of the four elements, battle some of the Vritra’s mightiest champions, and overcome a grievous betrayal. Meanwhile, visions of his past life are surfacing with startling frequency, forcing Arthur to contend with the decisions of his past as he struggles to retain a vision of his future.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw09r44s/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction &

this award-winning Audible Studios production, Trevor Noah tells his wild coming-of-age tale during the twilight of apartheid in South Africa. It’s a story that begins with his mother throwing him from a moving van to save him from a potentially fatal dispute with gangsters, then follows the budding comedian’s path to self-discovery through episodes both poignant and comical. Noah’s virtuoso embodiment of all the characters from his childhood, and his ability to perform accents and dialects effortlessly in English, Xhosa, and Zulu, garnered the Audie Award for Best Male Narrator in 2018. Nevertheless, Noah’s devoted and uncompromising mother—as voiced by her son—steals the show.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw0aaqp5/00-born_a_crime_stories_from_a_south_african_childhood-prolog.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Trevor Noah/Born A Crime/00-born_a_crime_stories_from_a_south_african_childhood-prolog.jpg","genres":["Arts & Entertainment","Entertainment & Performing Arts"],"lastUpdate":1636957790408,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Trevor Noah/Born A Crime","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Trevor Noah/Born A Crime","addedAt":1636957613382,"lastUpdate":1636957790408,"duration":31501596,"size":257121769,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":22,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":84.951,"title":"01-born_a_crime_stories_from_a_south_african_childhood-prolog"},{"id":1,"start":84.951,"end":233.066,"title":"02-born_a_crime_stories_from_a_south_african_childhood-prolog"},{"id":2,"start":233.066,"end":2101.5009999999997,"title":"03-born_a_crime_stories_from_a_south_african_childhood-prolog"},{"id":3,"start":2101.5009999999997,"end":3571.9339999999997,"title":"04-born_a_crime_stories_from_a_south_african_childhood-prolog"},{"id":4,"start":3571.9339999999997,"end":5424.224999999999,"title":"05-born_a_crime_stories_from_a_south_african_childhood-prolog"},{"id":5,"start":5424.224999999999,"end":6758.038,"title":"06-born_a_crime_stories_from_a_south_african_childhood-prolog"},{"id":6,"start":6758.038,"end":8416.971,"title":"07-born_a_crime_stories_from_a_south_african_childhood-prolog"},{"id":7,"start":8416.971,"end":10251.081,"title":"08-born_a_crime_stories_from_a_south_african_childhood-prolog"},{"id":8,"start":10251.081,"end":10975.3,"title":"09-born_a_crime_stories_from_a_south_african_childhood-prolog"},{"id":9,"start":10975.3,"end":12049.56,"title":"10-born_a_crime_stories_from_a_south_african_childhood-prolog"},{"id":10,"start":12049.56,"end":12193.652,"title":"11-born_a_crime_stories_from_a_south_african_childhood-prolog"},{"id":11,"start":12193.652,"end":13542.407,"title":"12-born_a_crime_stories_from_a_south_african_childhood-prolog"},{"id":12,"start":13542.407,"end":14192.23,"title":"13-born_a_crime_stories_from_a_south_african_childhood-prolog"},{"id":13,"start":14192.23,"end":14772.201,"title":"14-born_a_crime_stories_from_a_south_african_childhood-prolog"},{"id":14,"start":14772.201,"end":15576.824999999999,"title":"15-born_a_crime_stories_from_a_south_african_childhood-prolog"},{"id":15,"start":15576.824999999999,"end":16536.251,"title":"16-born_a_crime_stories_from_a_south_african_childhood-prolog"},{"id":16,"start":16536.251,"end":18696.996,"title":"17-born_a_crime_stories_from_a_south_african_childhood-prolog"},{"id":17,"start":18696.996,"end":18774.841,"title":"18-born_a_crime_stories_from_a_south_african_childhood-prolog"},{"id":18,"start":18774.841,"end":20835.328,"title":"19-born_a_crime_stories_from_a_south_african_childhood-prolog"},{"id":19,"start":20835.328,"end":23835.91,"title":"20-born_a_crime_stories_from_a_south_african_childhood-prolog"},{"id":20,"start":23835.91,"end":26216.554,"title":"21-born_a_crime_stories_from_a_south_african_childhood-prolog"},{"id":21,"start":26216.554,"end":31501.596,"title":"22-born_a_crime_stories_from_a_south_african_childhood-prolog"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0aejf2","ino":"7077323595360183405","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Legendborn","subtitle":null,"author":"Tracy Deonn","authorFL":"Tracy Deonn","authorLF":"Deonn, Tracy","narrator":"Joniece Abbott-Pratt","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2020","publisher":null,"description":"Filled with mystery and an intriguingly rich magic system, Tracy Deonn’s YA contemporary fantasy Legendborn offers the dark allure of City of Bones with a modern-day twist on a classic legend and a lot of Southern Black Girl Magic. After her mother dies in an accident, 16-year-old Bree Matthews wants nothing to do with her family memories or childhood home. A residential program for bright high schoolers at UNC-Chapel Hill seems like the perfect escape - until Bree witnesses a magical attack her very first night on campus. A flying demon feeding on human energies. A secret society of so-called “Legendborn” students that hunt the creatures down. And a mysterious teenage mage who calls himself a “Merlin” and who attempts - and fails - to wipe Bree’s memory of everything she saw. The mage’s failure reveals Bree’s own, unique magic and unlocks a buried memory with a hidden connection: the night her mother died, another Merlin was at the hospital. Now that Bree knows there’s more to her mother’s death than what’s on the police report, Bree will do whatever it takes to find out the truth, even if that means infiltrating the Legendborn as one of their initiates. She recruits Nick, a self-exiled Legendborn with his own grudge against the group, and their reluctant partnership pulls them deeper into the society’s secrets - and closer to each other.  But when the Legendborn reveal themselves as the descendants of King Arthur's knights and explain that a magical war is coming, Bree has to decide how far she’ll go for the truth and whether she should use her magic to take the society down - or join the fight.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0aejf2/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Teen & Young Adult","Literature & Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1636957795552,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Tracy Deonn/Legendborn","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Tracy Deonn/Legendborn","addedAt":1636957790415,"lastUpdate":1636957795552,"duration":68088660,"size":1103691364,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":1,"chapters":[],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0aeryb","ino":"2330295019659884498","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Surgecaller","subtitle":"Oathbound and Knighthood Surgecaller, Books 1-2","author":"Todd Herzman","authorFL":"Todd Herzman","authorLF":"Herzman, Todd","narrator":"John Pirhalla","series":"Surgecaller","volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2021","publisher":null,"description":"Contains books one and two of the Surgecaller series.

starlet as she reflects on her relentless rise to the top and the long-held secrets the public could never imagine - from the best-selling author of Daisy Jones & The Six. Reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now? Summoned to Evelyn’s luxurious apartment, Monique listens in fascination as the actress tells her story. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the ‘80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love. Monique begins to feel a very real connection to the legendary star, but as Evelyn’s story nears its conclusion, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways. \"Come for the glam Old Hollywood vibes; stay for a touching tale of a young reporter and a silver-screen legend.\" (Cosmopolitan)","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0b0w0a/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1636958869632,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Taylor Jenkins Reid/The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Taylor Jenkins Reid/The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo","addedAt":1636958833635,"lastUpdate":1636958869632,"duration":43851029,"size":711371011,"ebooks":[{"ino":"13524782360577885952","filetype":"ebook","filename":"Taylor Jenkins Reid - The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo (epub).epub","ext":".epub","path":"Taylor Jenkins Reid/The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo/Taylor Jenkins Reid - The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo (epub).epub","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Taylor Jenkins Reid/The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo/Taylor Jenkins Reid - The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo (epub).epub","addedAt":1636958833635}],"numEbooks":1,"numTracks":12,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":1430.309,"title":"Taylor Jenkins Reid - The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo [01-12]"},{"id":1,"start":1430.309,"end":5080.53,"title":"Taylor Jenkins Reid - The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo [02-12]"},{"id":2,"start":5080.53,"end":8508.344,"title":"Taylor Jenkins Reid - The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo [03-12]"},{"id":3,"start":8508.344,"end":12546.796999999999,"title":"Taylor Jenkins Reid - The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo [04-12]"},{"id":4,"start":12546.796999999999,"end":16685.586,"title":"Taylor Jenkins Reid - The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo [05-12]"},{"id":5,"start":16685.586,"end":21289.25,"title":"Taylor Jenkins Reid - The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo [06-12]"},{"id":6,"start":21289.25,"end":25426.028,"title":"Taylor Jenkins Reid - The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo [07-12]"},{"id":7,"start":25426.028,"end":28970.556999999997,"title":"Taylor Jenkins Reid - The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo [08-12]"},{"id":8,"start":28970.556999999997,"end":32460.150999999998,"title":"Taylor Jenkins Reid - The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo [09-12]"},{"id":9,"start":32460.150999999998,"end":36534.078,"title":"Taylor Jenkins Reid - The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo [10-12]"},{"id":10,"start":36534.078,"end":40057.265,"title":"Taylor Jenkins Reid - The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo [11-12]"},{"id":11,"start":40057.265,"end":43851.029,"title":"Taylor Jenkins Reid - The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo [12-12]"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0b1obm","ino":"11467275725336581637","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Maybe in Another Life","subtitle":null,"author":"Taylor Jenkins Reid","authorFL":"Taylor Jenkins Reid","authorLF":"Reid, Taylor Jenkins","narrator":"Julia Whelan","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2015","publisher":null,"description":"At the age of 29, Hannah Martin has lived in six different cities and held countless meaningless jobs. On the heels of leaving yet another city, Hannah moves back to Los Angeles and takes up residence in her best friend Gabby's guestroom. Hannah goes out to a bar one night with Gabby and meets up with her high school boyfriend, Ethan. Just after midnight, Gabby asks Hannah if she's ready to go. A moment later, Ethan offers to give her a ride later if she wants to stay. Hannah hesitates. What happens if she leaves with Gabby? What happens if she leaves with Ethan? In concurrent storylines, Hannah lives out the effects of each decision. Quickly these parallel universes develop into radically different stories with large-scale consequences for Hannah as well as the people around her.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0b1obm/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre

Jones & The Six and The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo.... Four famous siblings throw an epic party to celebrate the end of the summer. But over the course of 24 hours, their lives will change forever.  “One of the most anticipated [books] of the year - and rightfully so...It’s a must-read.”(Parade) Malibu: August 1983. It’s the day of Nina Riva’s annual end-of-summer party, and anticipation is at a fever pitch. Everyone wants to be around the famous Rivas: Nina, the talented surfer and supermodel; brothers Jay and Hud, one a championship surfer, the other a renowned photographer; and their adored baby sister, Kit. Together the siblings are a source of fascination in Malibu and the world over - especially as the offspring of the legendary singer Mick Riva. The only person not looking forward to the party of the year is Nina herself, who never wanted to be the center of attention, and who has also just been very publicly abandoned by her pro tennis player husband. Oh, and maybe Hud - because it is long past time for him to confess something to the brother from whom he’s been inseparable since birth. Jay, on the other hand, is counting the minutes until nightfall, when the girl he can’t stop thinking about promised she’ll be there. And Kit has a couple secrets of her own - including a guest she invited without consulting anyone. By midnight the party will be completely out of control. By morning, the Riva mansion will have gone up in flames. But before that first spark in the early hours before dawn, the alcohol will flow, the music will play, and the loves and secrets that shaped this family’s generations will all come rising to the surface. Malibu Rising is a story about one unforgettable night in the life of a family: the night they each have to choose what they will keep from the people who made them...and what they will leave behind.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0b4v48/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre

R. Martin “Groundbreaking.” —Patrick Rothfuss “One of the great fantasy epics of all time.” —Christopher Paolini New York Times-bestselling Tad Williams’ landmark epic fantasy saga of Osten Ard begins an exciting new cycle with THE WITCHWOOD CROWN, on sale now! With The Dragonbone Chair, Tad Williams introduced readers to the incredible fantasy world of Osten Ard. His beloved, internationally bestselling series Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn inspired a generation of modern fantasy writers, including George R.R. Martin, Patrick Rothfuss, and Christopher Paolini, and defined Tad Williams as one of the most important fantasy writers of our time. This edition features a brand-new introduction from Tad Williams' editor as well as the original introduction from Williams himself! BOOK ONE: THE DRAGONBONE CHAIR A war fueled by the powers of dark sorcery is about to engulf the peaceful land of Osten Ard—for Prester John, the High King, lies dying. And with his death, the Storm King, the undead ruler of the elf-like Sithi, seizes the chance to regain his lost realm through a pact with the newly ascended king. Knowing the consequences of this bargain, the king’s younger brother joins with a small, scattered group of scholars, the League of the Scroll, to confront the true danger threatening Osten Ard. Simon, a kitchen boy from the royal castle unknowingly apprenticed to a member of this League, will be sent on a quest that offers the only hope of salvation, a deadly riddle concerning long-lost swords of power. Compelled by fate and perilous magics, he must leave the only home he’s ever known and face enemies more terrifying than Osten Ard has ever seen, even as the land itself begins to die. After the landmark Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn trilogy, the epic saga of Osten Ard continues with the brand-new novel, The Heart of What Was Lost. Then don’t miss the upcoming trilogy, The Last King of Osten Ard, beginning with The Witchwood Crown! Praise for Osten Ard: “Inspired me to write my own seven-book trilogy....

Now Scarlett's father has arranged a marriage for her, and Scarlett thinks her dreams of seeing Caraval, the faraway once-a-year performance where the audience participates in the show, are over.  But this year Scarlett's long-dreamt-of invitation finally arrives. With the help of a mysterious sailor, Tella whisks Scarlett away to the show. Only as soon as they arrive, Tella is kidnapped by Caraval's mastermind organizer, Legend. It turns out that this season's Caraval revolves around Tella, and whoever finds her first is the winner.  Scarlett has been told that everything that happens during Caraval is only an elaborate performance. But she nevertheless becomes enmeshed in a game of love, heartbreak, and magic with the other players in the game. And whether Caraval is real or not, she must find Tella before the five nights of the game are over, a dangerous domino effect of consequences is set off, and her sister disappears forever.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw0ea6dq/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Stephanie Garber/Caraval/cover.jpg","genres":["Teen & Young Adult","Health, Lifestyle & Relationships"],"lastUpdate":1637008872697,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Stephanie Garber/Caraval","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Stephanie Garber/Caraval","addedAt":1636964305896,"lastUpdate":1637008872697,"duration":37137375,"size":602632889,"ebooks":[{"ino":"494101108298076009","filetype":"ebook","filename":"Stephanie Garber - Caraval.epub","ext":".epub","path":"Stephanie Garber/Caraval/Stephanie Garber - Caraval.epub","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Stephanie Garber/Caraval/Stephanie Garber - Caraval.epub","addedAt":1636964305896},{"ino":"5788375113089982107","filetype":"ebook","filename":"Stephanie Garber - Caraval.mobi","ext":".mobi","path":"Stephanie Garber/Caraval/Stephanie Garber - Caraval.mobi","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Stephanie Garber/Caraval/Stephanie Garber - Caraval.mobi","addedAt":1636964305896}],"numEbooks":2,"numTracks":9,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":3414.805,"title":"Stephanie Garber - Caraval [1-9]"},{"id":1,"start":3414.805,"end":7700.924999999999,"title":"Stephanie Garber - Caraval [2-9]"},{"id":2,"start":7700.924999999999,"end":12104.490999999998,"title":"Stephanie Garber - Caraval [3-9]"},{"id":3,"start":12104.490999999998,"end":16171.181999999997,"title":"Stephanie Garber - Caraval [4-9]"},{"id":4,"start":16171.181999999997,"end":20190.564999999995,"title":"Stephanie Garber - Caraval [5-9]"},{"id":5,"start":20190.564999999995,"end":24530.992999999995,"title":"Stephanie Garber - Caraval [6-9]"},{"id":6,"start":24530.992999999995,"end":29204.246999999996,"title":"Stephanie Garber - Caraval [7-9]"},{"id":7,"start":29204.246999999996,"end":33147.823,"title":"Stephanie Garber - Caraval [8-9]"},{"id":8,"start":33147.823,"end":37137.375,"title":"Stephanie Garber - Caraval [9-9]"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0ecvft","ino":"13132086510329549321","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"He Who Fights with Monsters 01","subtitle":null,"author":"Shirtaloon","authorFL":"Shirtaloon","authorLF":"Shirtaloon","narrator":"Heath Miller","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2021","publisher":null,"description":"Jason wakes up in a mysterious world of magic and monsters.

Now, Lynch brings back his outrageous hero for a caper so death-defying, nothing short of a miracle will pull it off. After a brutal battle with the underworld that nearly destroyed him, Locke and his trusted sidekick, Jean, fled the island city of their birth and landed on the exotic shores of Tal Verrar to nurse their wounds. But even at this westernmost edge of civilization, they can’t rest for long - and are soon back to what they do best: stealing from the undeserving rich and pocketing the proceeds for themselves. This time, however, they have targeted the grandest prize of all: the Sinspire, the most exclusive and heavily guarded gambling house in the world. Its nine floors attract the wealthiest clientele - and to rise to the top, one must impress with good credit, amusing behavior...and excruciatingly impeccable play. For there is one cardinal rule, enforced by Requin, the house’s cold-blooded master: It is death to cheat at any game at the Sinspire. Brazenly undeterred, Locke and Jean have orchestrated an elaborate plan to lie, trick, and swindle their way up the nine floors...straight to Requin’s teeming vault. Under the cloak of false identities, they meticulously make their climb - until they are closer to the spoils than ever. But someone in Tal Verrar has uncovered the duo’s secret. Someone from their past who has every intention of making the impudent criminals pay for their sins. Now, it will take every ounce of cunning to save their mercenary souls. And even that may not be enough.... Praise for Red Seas Under Red Skies \"Lynch hasn’t merely imagined a far-off world, he’s created it, put it all down on paper - the smells, the sounds, the people, the feel of the place. The novel is a virtuoso performance, and sf/fantasy fans will gobble it up.\" (Booklist starred review) \"Red Seas Under Red Skies firmly proves that Scott Lynch isn’t a one-hit wonder.... It’ll only be a matter of time before Scott Lynch is mentioned in the same breath as George R. R. Martin and Steven Erikson.\" (Fantasy Book Critic) \"Grand, grandiose, grandiloquent.... No critic is likely to fault Lynch in his overflowing qualities of inventiveness, audacious draftsmanship, and sympathetic characterization.\" (Locus)","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw0fctab/Gentleman Bastard 2 -

Torn between the many cultures that meet on the Chorhan Expanse, the greatest threat they now face is an expansionist army of monstrous nonhumans who call themselves the mansthein. To take her place as a full warrior of her tribe, Tani must travel across the vast grasslands of the Chorhan Expanse. But she has her sights set higher than a mere ritual journey: She wants to uncover a solution to the impending war that threatens her people.  Tani believes that peace may be possible, but there are others on both sides who believe in legends that tell of monsters with zealous devotion. All around her, warriors have their eyes on a glorious victory with no concern for the piles of bodies they'll create on the way. She will be joined by a killer pretending to be a healer, a mansthein commander struggling with his orders, a thief who pawned her heart of gold, and a strategist exiled from a foreign land. But none of them are the Hero.  It doesn't matter how many shades of gray might exist, some people see only in black and white. And the terrifying truth is that the stories they tell might not be just legends.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0fgjrw/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1636966493094,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Sarah Lin/The Brightest Shadow","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Sarah Lin/The Brightest Shadow","addedAt":1636966282851,"lastUpdate":1636966493101,"duration":116413150,"size":718402887,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":74,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":18.0,"title":"Sarah Lin -

a corrupt magician who created an inhuman army using animal bones. But victory came at a tragic price. Only four of the heroes survived. Since then, Kreya, the group’s leader, has exiled herself to a remote tower and devoted herself to one purpose: resurrecting her dead husband. But such a task requires both a cache of human bones and a sacrifice - for each day he lives, she will live one less.  She’d rather live one year with her husband than a hundred without him, but using human bones for magic is illegal in Vos. The dead are burned - as are any bone workers who violate the law. Yet Kreya knows where she can find the bones she needs: the battlefield where her husband and countless others lost their lives.  But defying the laws of the land exposes a terrible possibility. Maybe the dead don’t rest in peace after all.  Five warriors - one broken, one gone soft, one pursuing a simple life, one stuck in the past, and one who should dead. Their story should have been finished. But evil doesn’t stop just because someone once said, “the end”.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0fwa7x/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1636967112725,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Sarah Beth Durst/The Bone Maker","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Sarah Beth Durst/The Bone Maker","addedAt":1636967016177,"lastUpdate":1636967112725,"duration":59738703,"size":969035224,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":17,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":3355.873,"title":"The Bone Maker-Part01"},{"id":1,"start":3355.873,"end":6176.732,"title":"The Bone Maker-Part02"},{"id":2,"start":6176.732,"end":10518.257,"title":"The Bone Maker-Part03"},{"id":3,"start":10518.257,"end":15249.476999999999,"title":"The Bone Maker-Part04"},{"id":4,"start":15249.476999999999,"end":18724.599,"title":"The Bone Maker-Part05"},{"id":5,"start":18724.599,"end":22765.716,"title":"The Bone Maker-Part06"},{"id":6,"start":22765.716,"end":25734.010000000002,"title":"The Bone Maker-Part07"},{"id":7,"start":25734.010000000002,"end":29353.850000000002,"title":"The Bone Maker-Part08"},{"id":8,"start":29353.850000000002,"end":32373.266000000003,"title":"The Bone Maker-Part09"},{"id":9,"start":32373.266000000003,"end":36790.468,"title":"The Bone Maker-Part10"},{"id":10,"start":36790.468,"end":40302.632,"title":"The Bone Maker-Part11"},{"id":11,"start":40302.632,"end":43813.255,"title":"The Bone Maker-Part12"},{"id":12,"start":43813.255,"end":47038.515999999996,"title":"The Bone Maker-Part13"},{"id":13,"start":47038.515999999996,"end":48957.810999999994,"title":"The Bone Maker-Part14"},{"id":14,"start":48957.810999999994,"end":52170.58499999999,"title":"The Bone Maker-Part15"},{"id":15,"start":52170.58499999999,"end":55677.941999999995,"title":"The Bone Maker-Part16"},{"id":16,"start":55677.941999999995,"end":59738.702999999994,"title":"The Bone Maker-Part17"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0h7418","ino":"5297395692794525031","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Dark Wolf's Awakening","subtitle":null,"author":"Ryan Evans","authorFL":"Ryan Evans","authorLF":"Evans, Ryan","narrator":"Eric Michael Summerer","series":"Alpha Rising","volumeNumber":"1","publishYear":"2018","publisher":null,"description":"It has been thousands of years since beast-kind were united under one banner. The empire encompasses most of the known world, driving out or enslaving the lesser races without mercy. In a state of constant war and conquest, they have perfected the art of battle. For commoner wolf-kind Valian, being accepted and trained in a noble house's army was a dream come true. Without wealth or a family, it was his best shot at attaining honor and glory. Until fate intervened. When, on his graduation day, Valian discovers he's descended from an ancient and long-thought-extinct line, everything changes. Now, he'll have to come to terms with his newfound strength while joining a world he has never known. If the threat of his fellow beast-kind wasn't enough, a new danger has awoken on the empire's eastern border. If Valian doesn't rise to the occasion, more than just his own life may be lost. Fans of Throne of Glass and Sword of Truth will enjoy the dynamic combination of magic and action in Evans’ new series, Alpha Rising.

In exchange for her protection against enemy invaders, the humans promised to protect an unhatched brood of dragons. But when the dragons emerged as weak and misshapen hatchlings unable to fend for themselves, dragonkind seemed doomed to extinction. When even Tintaglia deserted the crippled young dragons, the Rain Wilders abandoned the burden of caring for the destructive and ravenous creatures. They were banished to a dangerous and grueling journey in search of their ancient dragon homeland, the lost city of Kelsingra, accompanied by a band of young and inexperienced human keepers, also deemed damaged and disposable. Against all odds they have found the fabled city, yet myriad challenges remain. Sintara, Mercor, Heeby, Relpda, and the rest of the dragons struggle to find their wings - and their independence. Their human escorts, too, must contend with unsettling upheaval: Thymara, Tats, Rapskal, Sedric, and the others are transforming into Elderlings - true dragon companions. As old rules give way to new alliances, secret fears, and adult desires, the keepers must redefine their lives as they attempt to reawaken Kelsingra to its former glory. But gaps in the dragons' memories leave them all struggling to recover the magic that once animated the great city. As the young Elderlings risk \"memory walking\" in the city's hidden history, an outside threat is growing. The Duke of Chalced has dispatched his forces to the Rain Wilds with a compelling mission: slaughter the dragons in an attempt to stave off his own demise. The tide of history is about to turn on a life-and-death battle that will ultimately decide the dragons' fate. If they win, the regal serpents will rule the world once more. And if they lose, they will vanish from the world forever.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0hk35n/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637003853462,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Robin Hobb/Rain Wilds 04 - Blood of Dragons","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Robin Hobb/Rain Wilds 04 - Blood of Dragons","addedAt":1636969806777,"lastUpdate":1637003853462,"duration":58215498,"size":943733171,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":2,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":30000.745,"title":"BloodofDragonsUnabridgedPart1"},{"id":1,"start":30000.745,"end":58215.498,"title":"BloodofDragonsUnabridgedPart2"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0igvdu","ino":"16083746378518491166","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Mad Ship","subtitle":null,"author":"Robin Hobb","authorFL":"Robin Hobb","authorLF":"Hobb, Robin","narrator":"Anne Flosnik","series":"Liveship Traders","volumeNumber":"2","publishYear":"1999","publisher":null,"description":"As the ancient tradition of Bingtown's Old Traders slowly erodes under the cold new order of a corrupt ruler, the Vestrits anxiously await the return of their liveship - a rare magic ship carved from sentient wizardwood, which bonds the ships mystically with those who sail them.

In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow. The dead are walking, men die impossible deaths, and it seems as though reality itself has become unstable: All are signs of the imminence of Tarmon Gai'don, the Last Battle, when Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, must confront the Dark One as humanity's only hope. Unbeknownst to Rand, Perrin has made his own truce with the Seanchan. It is a deal made with the Dark One, in his eyes, but he will do whatever is needed to rescue his wife, Faile, and destroy the Shaido who captured her. Among the Shaido, Faile works to free herself while hiding a secret that might give her her freedom or cause her destruction. And at a town called Malden, the Two Rivers longbow will be matched against Shaido spears.  Fleeing Ebou Dar through Seanchan-controlled Altara with the kidnapped Daughter of the Nine Moons, Mat attempts to court the woman to whom he is half-married, knowing that she will complete that ceremony eventually. But Tuon coolly leads him on a merry chase as he learns that even a gift can have deep significance among the Seanchan Blood and what he thinks he knows of women is not enough to save him.  In Caemlyn, Elayne fights to gain the Lion Throne while trying to avert what seems a certain civil war should she win the crown....  In the White Tower, Egwene struggles to undermine the sisters loyal to Elaida from within....  The winds of time have become a storm, and things that everyone believes are fixed in place forever are changing before their eyes.

A wastrel prince comes of age, finding a power he never imagined. Two worlds are destined to collide. Only one can be king. Ruka, called a demon at birth, is a genius. Born malformed and ugly into the snow-covered wasteland of the Ascom, he was spared from death by his mother's love. Now he is an outcast, consumed with hate for those who've wronged him. But to take his vengeance, he must first survive. Across a vast sea in the white-sand island paradise of Sri Kon, Kale is fourth and youngest son of the Sorcerer King. And at 16, Kale is a disappointment. As the first prince ever forced to serve with low-born marines, Kale must prove himself and become a man, or else lose all chance of a worthy future, and any hope to win the love of his life.

The war is over. The war has just begun. Three times throughout its history, Nikan has fought for its survival in the bloody Poppy Wars. Though the third battle has just ended, shaman and warrior Rin cannot forget the atrocity she committed to save her people. Now she is on the run from her guilt, the opium addiction that holds her like a vice, and the murderous commands of the fiery Phoenix - the vengeful god who has blessed Rin with her fearsome power.  Though she does not want to live, she refuses to die until she avenges the traitorous Empress who betrayed Rin’s homeland to its enemies. Her only hope is to join forces with the powerful Dragon Warlord, who plots to conquer Nikan, unseat the Empress, and create a new republic.  But neither the Empress nor the Dragon Warlord are what they seem. The more Rin witnesses, the more she fears her love for Nikan will force her to use the Phoenix’s deadly power once more.  Because there is nothing Rin won’t sacrifice to save her country...and exact her vengeance.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw0ppbn2/cover.png","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/R.F.

of the Heartwyld. But their glory days are long past; the mercs have grown apart and grown old, fat, drunk - or a combination of the three.  Then a former bandmate turns up at Clay's door with a plea for help: his daughter Rose is trapped in a city besieged by an enemy horde 100,000 strong and hungry for blood. Rescuing Rose is the kind of impossible mission that only the very brave or the very stupid would sign up for.  It's time to get the band back together for one last tour across the Wyld.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0tpbjr/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1636990589250,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Nicholas Eames/Kings of the Wyld","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Nicholas Eames/Kings of the Wyld","addedAt":1636990206567,"lastUpdate":1636990589250,"duration":63966643,"size":522206864,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":54,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":757.949,"title":"Kings of the Wyld -

That’s the official motto of the Scholomance. I suppose you could even argue that it’s true - only the wisdom is hard to come by, so the shelter’s rather scant.   Our beloved school does its best to devour all its students - but now that I’ve reached my senior year and have actually won myself a handful of allies, it’s suddenly developed a very particular craving for me. And even if I somehow make it through the endless waves of maleficaria that it keeps throwing at me in between grueling homework assignments, I haven’t any idea how my allies and I are going to make it through the graduation hall alive.   Unless, of course, I finally accept my foretold destiny of dark sorcery and destruction. That would certainly let me sail straight out of here. The course of wisdom, surely.  But I’m not giving in - not to the mals, not to fate, and especially not to the Scholomance. I’m going to get myself and my friends out of this hideous place for good - even if it’s the last thing I do.  With keen insight and mordant humor, Novik reminds us that sometimes it is not enough to rewrite the rules - sometimes, you need to toss out the entire rulebook. The magic of the Scholomance trilogy will continue in 2022.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0ue937/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1636991408828,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Naomi Novik/The Last Graduate","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Naomi Novik/The Last Graduate","addedAt":1636991369175,"lastUpdate":1636991408828,"duration":48450881,"size":775976991,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":16,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":19.854,"title":"001 Naomi Novik (2021) The Last Graduate"},{"id":1,"start":19.854,"end":3327.3509999999997,"title":"002 Naomi Novik (2021) The Last Graduate"},{"id":2,"start":3327.3509999999997,"end":6758.843,"title":"003 Naomi Novik (2021) The Last Graduate"},{"id":3,"start":6758.843,"end":10722.141,"title":"004 Naomi Novik (2021) The Last Graduate"},{"id":4,"start":10722.141,"end":14948.242999999999,"title":"005 Naomi Novik (2021) The Last Graduate"},{"id":5,"start":14948.242999999999,"end":17852.619,"title":"006 Naomi Novik (2021) The Last Graduate"},{"id":6,"start":17852.619,"end":21479.553,"title":"007 Naomi Novik (2021) The Last Graduate"},{"id":7,"start":21479.553,"end":24066.28,"title":"008 Naomi Novik (2021) The Last Graduate"},{"id":8,"start":24066.28,"end":25500.042999999998,"title":"009 Naomi Novik (2021) The Last Graduate"},{"id":9,"start":25500.042999999998,"end":28262.056999999997,"title":"010 Naomi Novik (2021) The Last Graduate"},{"id":10,"start":28262.056999999997,"end":32850.367,"title":"011 Naomi Novik (2021) The Last Graduate"},{"id":11,"start":32850.367,"end":35376.118,"title":"012 Naomi Novik (2021) The Last Graduate"},{"id":12,"start":35376.118,"end":38729.266,"title":"013 Naomi Novik (2021) The Last Graduate"},{"id":13,"start":38729.266,"end":43921.78200000001,"title":"014 Naomi Novik (2021) The Last Graduate"},{"id":14,"start":43921.78200000001,"end":48417.95500000001,"title":"015 Naomi Novik (2021) The Last Graduate"},{"id":15,"start":48417.95500000001,"end":48450.88100000001,"title":"016 Naomi Novik (2021) The Last Graduate"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0vgebl","ino":"8143183667181882329","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Ascendant","subtitle":null,"author":"Michael R.

Holt Cook was never meant to be a dragon rider. He has always served the Order Hall of the Crag dutifully, keeping their kitchen pots clean. Until he discovers a dark secret: Dragons do not tolerate weakness among their kin, killing the young they deem flawed. Moved by pity, Holt defies the Order, rescues a doomed egg, and vows to protect the blind dragon within. But the Scourge is rising. Undead hordes roam the land, spreading the blight and leaving destruction in their wake. The dragon riders are being slaughtered, and betrayal lurks in the shadows. Holt has one chance to survive. He must cultivate the mysterious power of his dragon's magical core, a unique energy that may tip the balance in the battles to come and prove to the world that a servant is worthy after all.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0vgebl/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1636993278229,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Michael R.

But nothing is simple in the crowded, narrow, mist-filled streets of Rochelle, where more than one ancient legend lurks.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0wdgmm/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637002612606,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Michael J Sullivan/Riyria Chronicles - 04 - The Disappearance of Winter's Daughter","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Michael J Sullivan/Riyria Chronicles - 04 - The Disappearance of Winter's Daughter","addedAt":1636994692218,"lastUpdate":1637002612606,"duration":49335177,"size":395328786,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":32,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":25.0,"title":"Chapter 0 (Opening Credits)"},{"id":1,"start":25.0,"end":351.0,"title":"Chapter 1 (Author’s Note)"},{"id":2,"start":351.0,"end":353.0,"title":"Chapter 2 (World Map)"},{"id":3,"start":353.0,"end":1899.99,"title":"Chapter 3 (Chapter 1)"},{"id":4,"start":1899.99,"end":4080.99,"title":"Chapter 4 (Chapter 2)"},{"id":5,"start":4080.99,"end":5618.99,"title":"Chapter 5 (Chapter 3)"},{"id":6,"start":5618.99,"end":7438.99,"title":"Chapter 6 (Chapter 4)"},{"id":7,"start":7438.99,"end":8526.99,"title":"Chapter 7 (Chapter 5)"},{"id":8,"start":8526.99,"end":10335.99,"title":"Chapter 8 (Chapter 6)"},{"id":9,"start":10335.99,"end":12172.99,"title":"Chapter 9 (Chapter 7)"},{"id":10,"start":12172.99,"end":14045.99,"title":"Chapter 10 (Chapter 8)"},{"id":11,"start":14045.99,"end":16323.99,"title":"Chapter 11 (Chapter 9)"},{"id":12,"start":16323.99,"end":17364.989999999998,"title":"Chapter 12 (Chapter 10)"},{"id":13,"start":17364.989999999998,"end":18620.989999999998,"title":"Chapter 13 (Chapter 11)"},{"id":14,"start":18620.989999999998,"end":20353.989999999998,"title":"Chapter 14 (Chapter 12)"},{"id":15,"start":20353.989999999998,"end":21396.989999999998,"title":"Chapter 15 (Chapter 13)"},{"id":16,"start":21396.989999999998,"end":23302.989999999998,"title":"Chapter 16 (Chapter 14)"},{"id":17,"start":23302.989999999998,"end":25067.989999999998,"title":"Chapter 17 (Chapter 15)"},{"id":18,"start":25067.989999999998,"end":26671.989999999998,"title":"Chapter 18 (Chapter 16)"},{"id":19,"start":26671.989999999998,"end":29126.989999999998,"title":"Chapter 19 (Chapter 17)"},{"id":20,"start":29126.989999999998,"end":30761.989999999998,"title":"Chapter 20 (Chapter 18)"},{"id":21,"start":30761.989999999998,"end":31402.989999999998,"title":"Chapter 21 (Chapter 19)"},{"id":22,"start":31402.989999999998,"end":35579.980998,"title":"Chapter 22 (Chapter 20)"},{"id":23,"start":35579.980998,"end":37524.980998,"title":"Chapter 23 (Chapter 21)"},{"id":24,"start":37524.980998,"end":39153.980998,"title":"Chapter 24 (Chapter 22)"},{"id":25,"start":39153.980998,"end":40461.980998,"title":"Chapter 25 (Chapter 23)"},{"id":26,"start":40461.980998,"end":41355.980998,"title":"Chapter 26 (Chapter 24)"},{"id":27,"start":41355.980998,"end":43094.980998,"title":"Chapter 27 (Chapter 25)"},{"id":28,"start":43094.980998,"end":44371.980998,"title":"Chapter 28 (Chapter 26)"},{"id":29,"start":44371.980998,"end":45849.980998,"title":"Chapter 29 (Chapter 27)"},{"id":30,"start":45849.980998,"end":47997.980998,"title":"Chapter 30 (Chapter 28)"},{"id":31,"start":47997.980998,"end":49320.980998,"title":"Chapter 31 (Chapter 29)"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0wh4w9","ino":"13346848355896725697","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"The Death of Dulgath","subtitle":null,"author":"Michael J Sullivan","authorFL":"Michael J Sullivan","authorLF":"Sullivan, Michael J","narrator":"Tim Gerard Reynolds; Michael J.

She hired Riyria. When the last member of the oldest noble family in Avryn is targeted for assassination, Riyria is hired to foil the plot. Three years have passed since the war-weary mercenary Hadrian and the cynical ex-assassin Royce joined forces to start life as thieves for hire. Things have gone well enough until they receive the odd assignment to prevent a murder. Now they must venture into a forgotten corner of southern Avryn - a place whose history predates the empire. As usual, challenges abound as they try to anticipate the moves of an unknown assassin before it's too late. But that's not their only problem. The countess of Dulgath has a dark secret she's determined to keep hidden. Then there's the little matter of Riyria's new employer...the Nyphron Church. From the best-selling author of The Riyria Revelations comes the third installment of The Riyria Chronicles. Although part of a series, it's designed to thrill both new listeners and Riyria veterans wishing to reunite with their favorite rogues.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0wh4w9/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637002634122,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Michael J Sullivan/Riyria Chronicles - 03 - The Death of Dulgath","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Michael J Sullivan/Riyria Chronicles - 03 - The Death of Dulgath","addedAt":1636994863051,"lastUpdate":1637002634122,"duration":50059218,"size":400882401,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":27,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":254.0,"title":"Chapter 0 (Opening Credits)"},{"id":1,"start":254.0,"end":2606.0,"title":"Chapter 1 (Chapter 1)"},{"id":2,"start":2606.0,"end":3775.0,"title":"Chapter 2 (Chapter 2)"},{"id":3,"start":3775.0,"end":5998.0,"title":"Chapter 3 (Chapter 3)"},{"id":4,"start":5998.0,"end":7097.0,"title":"Chapter 4 (Chapter 4)"},{"id":5,"start":7097.0,"end":8619.0,"title":"Chapter 5 (Chapter 5)"},{"id":6,"start":8619.0,"end":11195.0,"title":"Chapter 6 (Chapter 6)"},{"id":7,"start":11195.0,"end":12136.0,"title":"Chapter 7 (Chapter 7)"},{"id":8,"start":12136.0,"end":14040.0,"title":"Chapter 8 (Chapter 8)"},{"id":9,"start":14040.0,"end":17186.0,"title":"Chapter 9 (Chapter 9)"},{"id":10,"start":17186.0,"end":18811.0,"title":"Chapter 10 (Chapter 10)"},{"id":11,"start":18811.0,"end":20432.0,"title":"Chapter 11 (Chapter 11)"},{"id":12,"start":20432.0,"end":22425.0,"title":"Chapter 12 (Chapter 12)"},{"id":13,"start":22425.0,"end":24424.0,"title":"Chapter 13 (Chapter 13)"},{"id":14,"start":24424.0,"end":26264.0,"title":"Chapter 14 (Chapter 14)"},{"id":15,"start":26264.0,"end":27611.0,"title":"Chapter 15 (Chapter 15)"},{"id":16,"start":27611.0,"end":29786.0,"title":"Chapter 16 (Chapter 16)"},{"id":17,"start":29786.0,"end":31989.0,"title":"Chapter 17 (Chapter 17)"},{"id":18,"start":31989.0,"end":33534.0,"title":"Chapter 18 (Chapter 18)"},{"id":19,"start":33534.0,"end":34666.0,"title":"Chapter 19 (Chapter 19)"},{"id":20,"start":34666.0,"end":36542.961995,"title":"Chapter 20 (Chapter 20)"},{"id":21,"start":36542.961995,"end":38318.961995,"title":"Chapter 21 (Chapter 21)"},{"id":22,"start":38318.961995,"end":39880.961995,"title":"Chapter 22 (Chapter 22)"},{"id":23,"start":39880.961995,"end":41436.961995,"title":"Chapter 23 (Chapter 23)"},{"id":24,"start":41436.961995,"end":42548.961995,"title":"Chapter 24 (Chapter 24)"},{"id":25,"start":42548.961995,"end":45211.961995,"title":"Chapter 25 (Chapter 25)"},{"id":26,"start":45211.961995,"end":50045.961995,"title":"Chapter 26 (End Credits)"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0wmvtq","ino":"7293189803778075751","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"The Crown Tower","subtitle":null,"author":"Michael J Sullivan","authorFL":"Michael J Sullivan","authorLF":"Sullivan, Michael J","narrator":"Tim Gerard Reynolds","series":"The Riyria Chronicles","volumeNumber":"1","publishYear":"2013","publisher":null,"description":"Michael J.

Persephone keeps the human clans from turning on one another through her iron will and a compassionate heart. The arrogant Fhrey are barely held in check by their leader, Nyphron, who seeks to advance his own nefarious agenda through a loveless marriage that will result in the betrayal of the person Persephone loves most: Raithe, the God Killer.  As the Fhrey overlords marshal their army and sorcerers to crush the rebellion, old loyalties will be challenged while fresh conspiracies will threaten to undo all that Persephone has accomplished.

The Jedi Council has sent Depa Billaba - Mace’s former Padawan and fellow Council member - to Haruun Kal to train the local tribesmen as a guerrilla resistance force. But now the Separatists have pulled back, and Depa has not returned.

Would you choose differently?  'Between life and death there is a library,' she said. 'And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices. Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?' Thirty-four-year-old Nora's life could be better. She's lonely, single and has just lost her job. Her cat dying feels like the last straw. What else is there to live for? Then she finds a library between life and death where she gets to try all the other lives she could have lived.  The Midnight Library is a gloriously relatable novel about life, death and the in-between. It is about finding hope, playing chess, dumping regrets and picking the right people around you.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0zt0cc/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637000918314,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Matt Haig/The Midnight Library","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Matt Haig/The Midnight Library","addedAt":1637000456333,"lastUpdate":1637000918315,"duration":31795920,"size":391551933,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":74,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":298.61,"title":"The Midnight Library -

a shape-shifter able to transform himself into a winged creature of flight. An orphan with only vague memories of his own kind, Moon tries to fit in among the tribes of his river valley, with mixed success. Just as Moon is once again cast out by his adopted tribe, he discovers a shape-shifter like himself... someone who seems to know exactly what he is, who promises that Moon will be welcomed into his community. What this stranger doesn't tell Moon is that his presence will tip the balance of power... that his extraordinary lineage is crucial to the colony's survival... and that his people face extinction at the hands of the dreaded Fell! Now Moon must overcome a lifetime of conditioning in order to save himself - and his newfound kin.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1040hf/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637001064107,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Martha Wells/The Cloud Roads","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Martha Wells/The Cloud Roads","addedAt":1637000969161,"lastUpdate":1637001064107,"duration":54454944,"size":481747294,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":20,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":2474.712,"title":"Martha Wells - The Cloud Roads 01-20"},{"id":1,"start":2474.712,"end":5375.376,"title":"Martha Wells - The Cloud Roads 02-20"},{"id":2,"start":5375.376,"end":8357.568,"title":"Martha Wells - The Cloud Roads 03-20"},{"id":3,"start":8357.568,"end":10875.408,"title":"Martha Wells - The Cloud Roads 04-20"},{"id":4,"start":10875.408,"end":14190.743999999999,"title":"Martha Wells - The Cloud Roads 05-20"},{"id":5,"start":14190.743999999999,"end":17511.575999999997,"title":"Martha Wells - The Cloud Roads 06-20"},{"id":6,"start":17511.575999999997,"end":20393.352,"title":"Martha Wells - The Cloud Roads 07-20"},{"id":7,"start":20393.352,"end":23615.16,"title":"Martha Wells - The Cloud Roads 08-20"},{"id":8,"start":23615.16,"end":26515.392,"title":"Martha Wells - The Cloud Roads 09-20"},{"id":9,"start":26515.392,"end":29193.384,"title":"Martha Wells - The Cloud Roads 10-20"},{"id":10,"start":29193.384,"end":31376.064,"title":"Martha Wells - The Cloud Roads 11-20"},{"id":11,"start":31376.064,"end":33366.335999999996,"title":"Martha Wells - The Cloud Roads 12-20"},{"id":12,"start":33366.335999999996,"end":35197.75199999999,"title":"Martha Wells - The Cloud Roads 13-20"},{"id":13,"start":35197.75199999999,"end":37486.295999999995,"title":"Martha Wells - The Cloud Roads 14-20"},{"id":14,"start":37486.295999999995,"end":40288.488,"title":"Martha Wells - The Cloud Roads 15-20"},{"id":15,"start":40288.488,"end":42592.344,"title":"Martha Wells - The Cloud Roads 16-20"},{"id":16,"start":42592.344,"end":45301.871999999996,"title":"Martha Wells - The Cloud Roads 17-20"},{"id":17,"start":45301.871999999996,"end":48140.087999999996,"title":"Martha Wells - The Cloud Roads 18-20"},{"id":18,"start":48140.087999999996,"end":51793.776,"title":"Martha Wells - The Cloud Roads 19-20"},{"id":19,"start":51793.776,"end":54454.943999999996,"title":"Martha Wells - The Cloud Roads 20-20"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw106msx","ino":"10583207368095549021","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Network Effect","subtitle":null,"author":"Martha Wells","authorFL":"Martha Wells","authorLF":"Wells, Martha","narrator":"Kevin R.

Now, Mark Lawrence returns to the Broken Empire with the tale of a less ambitious prince. The Red Queen is old but the kings of the Broken Empire dread her like no other. For all her reign, she has fought the long war, contested in secret, against the powers that stand behind nations, for higher stakes than land or gold. Her greatest weapon is The Silent Sister - unseen by most and unspoken of by all. The Red Queen's grandson, Prince Jalan Kendeth - drinker, gambler, seducer of women - is one who can see The Silent Sister. Tenth in line for the throne and content with his role as a minor royal, he pretends that the hideous crone is not there. But war is coming. Witnesses claim an undead army is on the march, and the Red Queen has called on her family to defend the realm. Jal thinks it' s all a rumor - nothing that will affect him - but he is wrong. After escaping a death trap set by the Silent Sister, Jal finds his fate magically intertwined with a fierce Norse warrior. As the two undertake a journey across the Empire to undo the spell, encountering grave dangers, willing women, and an upstart prince named Jorg Ancrath along the way, Jalan gradually catches a glimmer of the truth: He and the Norseman are but pieces in a game, part of a series of moves in the long war - and the Red Queen controls the board.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1136c9/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637002612733,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Mark Lawrence/Prince of Fools","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Mark Lawrence/Prince of Fools","addedAt":1637002610411,"lastUpdate":1637002612733,"duration":52752016,"size":465461809,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":2,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":25620.181,"title":"Prince of Fools Part 1"},{"id":1,"start":25620.181,"end":52752.016,"title":"Prince of Fools Part 2"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw129j73","ino":"1936776634176160184","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Die For Me","subtitle":null,"author":"Luke Jennings","authorFL":"Luke Jennings","authorLF":"Jennings, Luke","narrator":"Lucy Paterson","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2020","publisher":null,"description":"Following the wildly popular BBC America adaption of Codename Villanelle, a high-stakes, addictive installment of Jennings's acclaimed Killing Eve series.

Ashok Vadal was once a member of the highest caste in all of Lok. As a Protector, he devoted his life to upholding the Law, rooting out those who still practiced the old ways and delivering swift justice with his ancestor blade Angruvadal. None was more merciless than he in stamping out the lingering belief in gods and demons among the casteless. His brutality was legendary and celebrated. But soon Ashok learned that his life to that point had been a lie. He himself, senior member of the Protector Order, was casteless. He had been nothing more than an unwitting pawn in a political game. His world turned upside down, and finding himself on the wrong side of the Law, he began a campaign of rebellion, war, and destruction unlike any Lok had ever seen. Thera had been first daughter of Vane. A member of the Warrior Order, she had spent her life training for combat. Until a strange sight in the heavens appeared one day. Thera was struck by lighting, and from that day forward, she heard the Voice. A reluctant prophet with the power to see into the future, she fought alongside Ashok Vadal and his company of men known as the Sons of the Black Sword, until a shape-shifting wizard with designs on her powers of precognition spirited her away. He holds her prisoner in the House of Assassins. Ashok Vadal and the Sons of the Black Sword march to rescue Thera. With his sword Angruvadal, Ashok was unstoppable. But Angruvadal is gone, shattered to pieces on the demon-possessed husk of a warrior. Now, Ashok must fight without the aid of the magic blade for the first time. Thera’s life depends on it. But there is much more at risk in the continent of Lok. Strange forces are working behind the scenes.  Ashok Vadal and the Sons of the Black Sword are caught up in a game they do not fully understand, with powerful forces allied against them. Ashok no longer knows what to believe. He is beginning to think perhaps the gods really do exist. If so, he’s warned them to stay out of his way. They would do well to listen. About House of Assassins: “Correia piles on the intrigue, action, and cliffhangers in the invigorating second Saga of the Forgotten Warrior epic fantasy.... Correia also weaves in elements that question the value of belief and the cost of giving authority to those who find more profit in preying on the weak.... Brisk fight scenes, lively characters, and plenty of black humor continue to make this series a real pleasure.” (Publishers Weekly) Larry Correia is the creator of The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times best-selling Monster Hunter series, as well as urban fantasy hard-boiled adventure saga the Grimnoir Chronicles and epic fantasy series The Saga of the Forgotten Warrior.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw138krw/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction &

Lane's life is good. She has great friends, a decent job, and a car that breaks down only every other week or so. In other words, she's your perfectly ordinary 21st-century woman. Or so she thinks...until something extraordinary happens. When her sister is murdered, leaving a single clue to her death - a cryptic message on Mac's cell phone - Mac journeys to Ireland in search of answers. The quest to find her sister's killer draws her into a shadowy realm where nothing is as it seems, where good and evil wear the same treacherously seductive mask. She is soon faced with an even greater challenge: staying alive long enough to learn how to handle a power she had no idea she possessed - a gift that allows her to see beyond the world of man, into the dangerous realm of the Fae. As Mac delves deeper into the mystery of her sister's death, her every move is shadowed by the dark, mysterious Jericho, a man with no past and only mockery for a future. As she begins to close in on the truth, the ruthless Vlane - an alpha Fae who makes sex an addiction for human women - closes in on her. And as the boundary between worlds begins to crumble, Mac's true mission becomes clear: find the elusive Sinsar Dubh before someone else claims the all-powerful Dark Book - because whoever gets to it first holds nothing less than complete control of the very fabric of both worlds.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw13u3jd/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Classics"],"lastUpdate":1637007420556,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Karen Marie Moning/Darkfever","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Karen Marie Moning/Darkfever","addedAt":1637007225765,"lastUpdate":1637007420557,"duration":31989141,"size":259964826,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":16,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":2259.932,"title":"Darkfever-001"},{"id":1,"start":2259.932,"end":3861.7349999999997,"title":"Darkfever-002"},{"id":2,"start":3861.7349999999997,"end":5917.912,"title":"Darkfever-003"},{"id":3,"start":5917.912,"end":7836.267,"title":"Darkfever-004"},{"id":4,"start":7836.267,"end":9828.94,"title":"Darkfever-005"},{"id":5,"start":9828.94,"end":11964.634,"title":"Darkfever-006"},{"id":6,"start":11964.634,"end":13866.897,"title":"Darkfever-007"},{"id":7,"start":13866.897,"end":15963.851,"title":"Darkfever-008"},{"id":8,"start":15963.851,"end":18240.266,"title":"Darkfever-009"},{"id":9,"start":18240.266,"end":20063.953,"title":"Darkfever-010"},{"id":10,"start":20063.953,"end":22306.435,"title":"Darkfever-011"},{"id":11,"start":22306.435,"end":23935.954,"title":"Darkfever-012"},{"id":12,"start":23935.954,"end":26099.154000000002,"title":"Darkfever-013"},{"id":13,"start":26099.154000000002,"end":27844.448000000004,"title":"Darkfever-014"},{"id":14,"start":27844.448000000004,"end":30126.532000000003,"title":"Darkfever-015"},{"id":15,"start":30126.532000000003,"end":31989.141000000003,"title":"Darkfever-016"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw13ybhw","ino":"16469883876446351997","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"The Lost War","subtitle":null,"author":"Justin Lee Anderson","authorFL":"Justin Lee Anderson","authorLF":"Anderson, Justin Lee","narrator":"Euan Morton","series":"Eidyn Trilogy","volumeNumber":"1","publishYear":"2019","publisher":null,"description":"\"Strikingly intense...immersive and thoroughly compelling.\" (SFX) \"Compelling and entertaining...inventive and fun.\" (SciFiNow) The war is over, but something is rotten in the state of Eidyn.

journey through a labyrinthine world and the mysteries he uncovers along the way (Los Angeles Times). As Marat's siege engine bores through the Tower, erupting inside ringdoms and leaving chaos in its wake, Senlin can do nothing but observe the mayhem from inside the belly of the beast. Caught in a charade, Senlin desperately tries to sabotage the rampaging Hod King, even as Marat's objective grows increasingly clear. The leader of the zealots is bound for the Sphinx's lair and the unimaginable power it contains. In the city under glass at the Tower's summit, Adam discovers a utopia where everyone inexplicably knows the details of his past. As Adam unravels the mystery of his fame, he soon discovers the crowning ringdom conceals a much darker secret. Aboard the State of Art, Edith and her crew adjust to the reality that Voleta has awoken from death changed. She seems to share more in common with the Red Hand now than her former self. While Edith wars for the soul of the young woman, a greater crisis looms: They will have to face Marat on unequal footing and with Senlin caught in the crossfire. And when the Bridge of Babel is finally opened, and the Brick Layer's true ambition revealed, neither they nor the Tower will ever be the same again.

Queen of Air and Darkness, Harry never knows what the scheming Mab might want him to do. Usually, it’s something awful. He doesn’t know the half of it.… Mab has just traded Harry's skills to pay off one of her debts. And now he must help a group of supernatural villains - led by one of Harry's most dreaded and despised enemies, Nicodemus Archleone - to break into the highest-security vault in town, so that they can then access the highest-security vault in the Nevernever. It's a smash-and-grab job to recover the literal Holy Grail from the vaults of the greatest treasure hoard in the supernatural world - which belongs to the one and only Hades, Lord of the freaking Underworld and generally unpleasant character. Worse, Dresden suspects that there is another game afoot that no one is talking about. And he's dead certain that Nicodemus has no intention of allowing any of his crew to survive the experience. Especially Harry. Dresden's always been tricky, but he's going to have to up his backstabbing game to survive this mess - assuming his own allies don’t end up killing him before his enemies get the chance.…","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw16ekih/Skin Game A Novel of the Dresden Files, Book 15.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Jim Butcher/The Dresden Files 15 -

The world of Dematr had been locked unchanging for centuries by the Great Guilds, most people living in a world of oil lamps, crossbows, and horse cavalry, the Mechanics reserving to themselves the technology for steam locomotives, rifles, and far-talkers while the Mages treated all others as if they were nothing - until Master Mechanic Mari, dragon slayer and pirate queen, and Master of Mages Alain raised the army of the new day to free their world. Kira of Pacta Servanda, the daughter of the two greatest heroes of her world, was six years old the day she stood on a battlement in Dorcastle, staring up at a statue of her mother while surrounded by bodyguards who fenced Kira off from the nearby crowds. As the morning sun cast the shadow of Mari's statue over Kira, she realized that she would spend the rest of her life in that shade. Then the world of Dematr learned that a new kind of ship had left the far-distant world of Urth. The ship would take only 10 years to cover the immense distances between stars. Of all the colony worlds, the ship was coming to Dematr. But for what purpose? Kira was 16 when the ship from Urth arrived, and she discovered that her world still needed heroes.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw1cw4nt/Daughter of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 1.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Jack Campbell/Daughter of Dragons/Daughter of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 1.jpg","genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637042136308,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Jack Campbell/Daughter of Dragons","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Jack Campbell/Daughter of Dragons","addedAt":1637022436328,"lastUpdate":1637042136308,"duration":41256559,"size":252712676,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":16,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":2937.511,"title":"Daughter of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 1 - 01"},{"id":1,"start":2937.511,"end":5578.642,"title":"Daughter of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 1 - 02"},{"id":2,"start":5578.642,"end":8534.264,"title":"Daughter of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 1 - 03"},{"id":3,"start":8534.264,"end":11088.412999999999,"title":"Daughter of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 1 - 04"},{"id":4,"start":11088.412999999999,"end":13724.434999999998,"title":"Daughter of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 1 - 05"},{"id":5,"start":13724.434999999998,"end":16134.758999999998,"title":"Daughter of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 1 - 06"},{"id":6,"start":16134.758999999998,"end":18709.805999999997,"title":"Daughter of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 1 - 07"},{"id":7,"start":18709.805999999997,"end":20651.877999999997,"title":"Daughter of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 1 - 08"},{"id":8,"start":20651.877999999997,"end":22882.108999999997,"title":"Daughter of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 1 - 09"},{"id":9,"start":22882.108999999997,"end":25941.291999999998,"title":"Daughter of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 1 - 10"},{"id":10,"start":25941.291999999998,"end":28191.816,"title":"Daughter of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 1 - 11"},{"id":11,"start":28191.816,"end":30911.895,"title":"Daughter of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 1 - 12"},{"id":12,"start":30911.895,"end":32698.763,"title":"Daughter of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 1 - 13"},{"id":13,"start":32698.763,"end":35260.11,"title":"Daughter of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 1 - 14"},{"id":14,"start":35260.11,"end":38033.827,"title":"Daughter of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 1 - 15"},{"id":15,"start":38033.827,"end":41256.558999999994,"title":"Daughter of Dragons The Legacy of Dragons, Book 1 - 16"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1fgrdo","ino":"691117622572749318","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Son of a Liche","subtitle":null,"author":"J.

A band of accident-prone adventurers. Giving redemption a second shot may have been a grave mistake.... Still bruised and heartbroken from their last calamitous quest, Gorm Ingerson and his band of washed-up heroes try to make amends for the orcs they accidentally betrayed. But justice is put on hold when an old foe marches to the city gates. Gorm is horrified to discover a liche pitching the frightened city-dwellers on the merits of the undead lifestyle...at the head of a corpse army. To save the city from high-pressure sales tactics and an inevitable siege, the dwarf warrior and his misfit band hatch a harebrained scheme that lands them at the top of the king’s kill list. With death and dark magic on his heels, Gorm must craft his own pitch to round up the troops and put the undead snake-oil salesman and his army of pushers permanently out of business. Son of a Liche is the second book in The Dark Profit Saga, a trilogy of humorous epic fantasy novels. If you like rib-tickling shenanigans, second-rate heroes, and imaginative new takes on tired tropes, then you’ll love J. Zachary Pike’s hilarious blend of finance and high fantasy.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw1fgrdo/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/J.

It doesn't help that she has Asperger's and that French kissing reminds her of a shark getting its teeth cleaned by pilot fish. She decides that she needs lots of practice - with a professional - which is why she hires escort Michael Phan.  The Vietnamese-Swedish stunner can't afford to turn down Stella's offer, and he agrees to help her check off all the boxes on her lesson plan - from foreplay to more-than-missionary position...

The Asharite empire has splintered into decadent city-states led by warring petty kings. King Almalik of Cartada is on the ascendancy, aided always by his friend and advisor, the notorious Ammar ibn Khairan - poet, diplomat, soldier - until a summer afternoon of savage brutality changes their relationship forever. Meanwhile, in the north, the conquered Jaddites' most celebrated - and feared - military leader, Rodrigo Belmonte, driven into exile, leads his mercenary company south. In the dangerous lands of Al-Rassan, these two men from different worlds meet and serve - for a time - the same master. Sharing their interwoven fate - and increasingly torn by her feelings - is Jehane, the accomplished court physician, whose own skills play an increasing role as Al-Rassan is swept to the brink of holy war, and beyond. Hauntingly evocative of medieval Spain, The Lions of Al-Rassan is both a brilliant adventure and a deeply compelling story of love, divided loyalties, and what happens to men and women when hardening beliefs begin to remake - or destroy - a world.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1ggtme/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637028684202,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Guy Gavriel Kay/The Lions of Al-Rasan","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Guy Gavriel Kay/The Lions of Al-Rasan","addedAt":1637028441472,"lastUpdate":1637028684202,"duration":67094282,"size":208607025,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":56,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":1184.549,"title":"Guy Gavriel Kay -

Lightning snarls and barks. Rage is an animate force upon the plain of glittering stone. Even shadows are afraid. At the heart of the plain stands a vast grey stronghold, unknown, older than any written memory. One ancient tower has collapsed across the fissure. From the heart of the vastness comes a great, deep, slow breath like that of a slumbering world-heart, cracking the olden silence. Death is eternity. Eternity is stone. Stone is silence. Stone cannot speak, but stone remembers. So begins the next movement of Glittering Stone....The tale again comes to us from the pen of Murgen, Annalist and Standard Bearer of the Black Company, whose developing powers of travel through space and time give him a perspective like no other. Led by the wily commander, Croaker, and the Lady, the Company is working for the Taglian government, but neither the Company nor the Taglians are overflowing with trust for each other. Arrayed against both is a similarly tenuous alliance of sorcerers, including the diabolical Soulcatcher, the psychotic Howler, and a four-year-old child who may be the most powerful of all.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw1hzwoz/08 -

an orphan, a ghoul and a cursed man - are accused of a crime they didn't commit. Their quest for revenge exposes a perilous conspiracy, the seeds of which were sown long before they were born. A centuries-old magical war is on the verge of reigniting, and in the tunnels deep below the city, a malevolent power stirs. Only by standing together can the three friends prevent a conflict that would bring total devastation to their city - and the world beyond. Set in a world of dark gods and dangerous magic, The Gutter Prayer is thrilling and visceral debut fantasy from an exciting new talent.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1jb7he/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637033607848,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Gareth Hanrahan/The Gutter Prayer","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Gareth Hanrahan/The Gutter Prayer","addedAt":1637033217580,"lastUpdate":1637033607849,"duration":61023484,"size":497236359,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":45,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":851.155,"title":"Gareth Hanrahan -

Wry, wise, and often laugh-out-loud funny, it’s a wholly original story that delivers pure pleasure.” (People)  From the number one New York Times best-selling author of A Man Called Ove comes a charming poignant novel about a crime that never took place, a would-be bank robber who disappears into thin air, and eight extremely anxious strangers who find they have more in common than they ever imagined. Looking at real estate isn’t usually a life-or-death situation, but an apartment open house becomes just that when a failed bank robber bursts in and takes a group of strangers hostage. The captives include a recently retired couple who relentlessly hunts down fixer-uppers to avoid the painful truth that they can’t fix their own marriage. There’s a wealthy bank director who has been too busy to care about anyone else and a young couple who are about to have their first child but can’t seem to agree on anything, from where they want to live to how they met in the first place. Add to the mix an 87-year-old woman who has lived long enough not to be afraid of someone waving a gun in her face, a flustered but still-ready-to-make-a-deal real estate agent, and a mystery man who has locked himself in the apartment’s only bathroom, and you’ve got the worst group of hostages in the world.  Each of them carries a lifetime of grievances, hurts, secrets, and passions that are ready to boil over. None of them is entirely who they appear to be. And all of them - the bank robber included - desperately crave some sort of rescue. As the authorities and the media surround the premises, these reluctant allies will reveal surprising truths about themselves and set in motion a chain of events so unexpected that even they can hardly explain what happens next.  Rich with Fredrik Backman’s “pitch-perfect dialogue and an unparalleled understanding of human nature” (Shelf Awareness), Anxious People is an ingeniously constructed story about the enduring power of friendship, forgiveness, and hope - the things that save us, even in the most anxious times.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw1jp5d0/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Fredrik Backman/Anxious People/cover.jpg","genres":["Literature & Fiction","Humor &

In this short story, myths, fables, and legends from around the world are combined to recount the adventures of Fintán mac Bóchra and Myrddin Wyllt in ancient Ireland and tell the “true” tale of the global disaster known as the Great Flood.  \"...Then a sound came to them. It began as a rumbling in the deep, then boomed so forcefully even Fintán was amazed. The sound continued, unbroken, growing in intensity. Quivering ripples appeared in the waves, droplets leapt on the surface, water beaded and danced on deck. The ship vibrated so harshly people fell, teeth rattling, vision blurred. Planks loosed at the seams.    \"On the orlop deck and in the hold, crocks of water and wine shattered and livestock bleated in terror. \"A primal fear gripped the people on those ships.

The money she collects goes to keep her little sister living in comfort, far from the bloody streets they grew up on. When Isoka's magic is discovered by the government, she's arrested and brought to the Emperor's spymaster, who sends her on an impossible mission: Steal Soliton, a legendary ghost ship - a ship from which no one has ever returned.

Sweeping from the majestic city of Ashoka to the perilous Wildness beyond her borders, enter a world where Caste determines mystical Talents, the purity of Jivatma expresses worth, and dharma may be based on a lie. Rukh Shektan has always understood duty. As a member of Caste Kumma, the warrior Caste, nothing else is acceptable. He is expected to take part in the deadly Trials, to journey the Wildness and protect the caravans linking Humanity's far-flung cities. Though the mission is dangerous, Rukh's hope and optimism are undaunted. Karma, however, is a fickle fiend. His caravan is destroyed by the monstrous Chimeras; twisted servants of their fearful goddess, Suwraith. While Rukh survives the attack, events force him along an uncertain path. Morality becomes a morass - especially when he encounters a mysterious warrior, Jessira Grey, a woman whose existence ought to be impossible. The holy texts warn against her kind: ghrinas, children of two Castes, abominations. They are to be executed whenever discovered, but for the first time in his life, Rukh defies duty. Jessira may be the key to his city's survival. Meanwhile, a secret society seeks Ashoka's demise; foul murders cloak a deadlier purpose; and behind it all looms Suwraith. But it is the Baels, the leaders of Her Chimeras, who may hide the greatest deception of all. Book 2, A Warrior's Knowledge, is also available.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1myywp/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":"/metadata/books/kw1myywp/cover.jpg","genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637039796103,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Davis Ashura/A Warrior's Path","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Davis Ashura/A Warrior's Path","addedAt":1637039365352,"lastUpdate":1637039796103,"duration":61895625,"size":756762796,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":26,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":13.054,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 01 of 26"},{"id":1,"start":13.054,"end":2964.914,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 02 of 26"},{"id":2,"start":2964.914,"end":6819.798000000001,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 03 of 26"},{"id":3,"start":6819.798000000001,"end":10018.300000000001,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 04 of 26"},{"id":4,"start":10018.300000000001,"end":12761.227,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 05 of 26"},{"id":5,"start":12761.227,"end":15712.438,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 06 of 26"},{"id":6,"start":15712.438,"end":18997.319,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 07 of 26"},{"id":7,"start":18997.319,"end":20264.385,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 08 of 26"},{"id":8,"start":20264.385,"end":22145.108,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 09 of 26"},{"id":9,"start":22145.108,"end":24022.209,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 10 of 26"},{"id":10,"start":24022.209,"end":28417.792999999998,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 11 of 26"},{"id":11,"start":28417.792999999998,"end":29753.033,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 12 of 26"},{"id":12,"start":29753.033,"end":31268.833,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 13 of 26"},{"id":13,"start":31268.833,"end":32695.653,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 14 of 26"},{"id":14,"start":32695.653,"end":35470.994999999995,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 15 of 26"},{"id":15,"start":35470.994999999995,"end":36080.844,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 16 of 26"},{"id":16,"start":36080.844,"end":38053.240999999995,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 17 of 26"},{"id":17,"start":38053.240999999995,"end":41652.56599999999,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 18 of 26"},{"id":18,"start":41652.56599999999,"end":43220.88799999999,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 19 of 26"},{"id":19,"start":43220.88799999999,"end":47061.422999999995,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 20 of 26"},{"id":20,"start":47061.422999999995,"end":49384.67199999999,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 21 of 26"},{"id":21,"start":49384.67199999999,"end":53106.87699999999,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 22 of 26"},{"id":22,"start":53106.87699999999,"end":55630.42199999999,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 23 of 26"},{"id":23,"start":55630.42199999999,"end":61844.221999999994,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 24 of 26"},{"id":24,"start":61844.221999999994,"end":61874.221999999994,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 25 of 26"},{"id":25,"start":61874.221999999994,"end":61895.62499999999,"title":"Davis Ashura - CO1 A Warrior's Path - 26 of 26"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1n9uia","ino":"16439366038503986009","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Frankly in Love","subtitle":null,"author":"David Yoon","authorFL":"David Yoon","authorLF":"Yoon, David","narrator":"Raymond J.

Questions plague those entering this particular place of power: Where do the \"rewards\" of weapons, armor, and heavy gold coins come from? Why is a fluffy bunny charging at me?

With the help of an energetic friend, Cal grows a dungeon around himself to bring in new sources of power.  When a threat he doesn't fully comprehend bares its many teeth, Cal is determined to survive the attempt on his life. Unfortunately for adventurers, the only way for him to achieve his goal is to eat anyone that enters his

Rider - was nothing more than a poor farm boy, and his dragon, Saphira, only a blue stone in the forest. Now the fate of an entire civilization rests on their shoulders. Long months of training and battle have brought victories and hope, but they have also brought heartbreaking loss. And still, the real battle lies ahead: they must confront Galbatorix. When they do, they will have to be strong enough to defeat him. And if they cannot, no one can. There will be no second chances. The Rider and his dragon have come further than anyone dared to hope. But can they topple the evil king and restore justice to Alagaësia? And if so, at what cost? This is the much-anticipated, astonishing conclusion to the worldwide bestselling Inheritance cycle.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1nxw4r/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Children's Audiobooks","Animals &

even love - in this witty and swoon-worthy romance from the New York Times best-selling duo who “hilariously depict modern dating” (Us Weekly) and authors of Josh and Hazel’s Guide to Not Dating and Roomies. Olive is always unlucky: in her career, in love, in...well, everything. Her identical twin sister, Amy, on the other hand, is probably the luckiest person in the world. Her meet-cute with her fiancé is something out of a romantic comedy (gag), and she’s managed to finance her entire wedding by winning a series of internet contests (double gag). Worst of all, she’s forcing Olive to spend the day with her sworn enemy, Ethan, who just happens to be the best man. Olive braces herself to get through 24 hours of wedding hell before she can return to her comfortable, unlucky life. But when the entire wedding party gets food poisoning from eating bad shellfish, the only people who aren’t affected are Olive and Ethan. And now, there’s an all-expenses-paid honeymoon in Hawaii up for grabs. Putting their mutual hatred aside for the sake of a free vacation, Olive and Ethan head for paradise, determined to avoid each other at all costs. But when Olive runs into her future boss, the little white lie she tells him is suddenly at risk to become a whole lot bigger. She and Ethan now have to pretend to be loving newlyweds, and her luck seems worse than ever. But the weird thing is that she doesn’t mind playing pretend. In fact, she feels kind of...lucky. With Christina Lauren’s “uniquely hilarious and touching voice” (Entertainment Weekly), The Unhoneymooners is a fun and charming romance that is perfect for anyone who has ever felt unlucky in love.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw1plshw/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Christina Lauren/The Unhoneymooners/cover.jpg","genres":["Literature & Fiction","Humor & Satire"],"lastUpdate":1637043874694,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Christina Lauren/The Unhoneymooners","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Christina Lauren/The Unhoneymooners","addedAt":1637043788981,"lastUpdate":1637043874694,"duration":32845728,"size":522857565,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":21,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":1392.64,"title":"001 Christina Lauren (2019) The Unhoneymooners"},{"id":1,"start":1392.64,"end":3004.686,"title":"002 Christina Lauren (2019) The Unhoneymooners"},{"id":2,"start":3004.686,"end":4109.724,"title":"003 Christina Lauren (2019) The Unhoneymooners"},{"id":3,"start":4109.724,"end":6055.859,"title":"004 Christina Lauren (2019) The Unhoneymooners"},{"id":4,"start":6055.859,"end":7597.339,"title":"005 Christina Lauren (2019) The Unhoneymooners"},{"id":5,"start":7597.339,"end":9749.086,"title":"006 Christina Lauren (2019) The Unhoneymooners"},{"id":6,"start":9749.086,"end":11464.135999999999,"title":"007 Christina Lauren (2019) The Unhoneymooners"},{"id":7,"start":11464.135999999999,"end":12850.577,"title":"008 Christina Lauren (2019) The Unhoneymooners"},{"id":8,"start":12850.577,"end":16276.078,"title":"009 Christina Lauren (2019) The Unhoneymooners"},{"id":9,"start":16276.078,"end":18285.696,"title":"010 Christina Lauren (2019) The Unhoneymooners"},{"id":10,"start":18285.696,"end":20129.965,"title":"011 Christina Lauren (2019) The Unhoneymooners"},{"id":11,"start":20129.965,"end":21425.685,"title":"012 Christina Lauren (2019) The Unhoneymooners"},{"id":12,"start":21425.685,"end":22542.124,"title":"013 Christina Lauren (2019) The Unhoneymooners"},{"id":13,"start":22542.124,"end":23493.4,"title":"014 Christina Lauren (2019) The Unhoneymooners"},{"id":14,"start":23493.4,"end":25544.373,"title":"015 Christina Lauren (2019) The Unhoneymooners"},{"id":15,"start":25544.373,"end":26895.032,"title":"016 Christina Lauren (2019) The Unhoneymooners"},{"id":16,"start":26895.032,"end":27789.07,"title":"017 Christina Lauren (2019) The Unhoneymooners"},{"id":17,"start":27789.07,"end":28622.388,"title":"018 Christina Lauren (2019) The Unhoneymooners"},{"id":18,"start":28622.388,"end":30088.636,"title":"019 Christina Lauren (2019) The Unhoneymooners"},{"id":19,"start":30088.636,"end":31458.984999999997,"title":"020 Christina Lauren (2019) The Unhoneymooners"},{"id":20,"start":31458.984999999997,"end":32845.727999999996,"title":"021 Christina Lauren (2019) The Unhoneymooners"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1pv8ld","ino":"3859638213324507786","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Of Sand and Snow","subtitle":null,"author":"Bryce O'Connor","authorFL":"Bryce O'Connor","authorLF":"O'Connor, Bryce","narrator":"Mikael Naramore","series":"The Wings of War","volumeNumber":"5","publishYear":"2019","publisher":null,"description":"With 50,000 freed slaves at their back, Raz i'Syul Arro and Syrah Brahnt leave the savannahs of Perce behind.

From underground tunnels to the tops of trees, the fearless Redwallers, with the help of their woodland friends, battle some of their most vicious enemies yet in an exhilarating, terrifying treasure hunt.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1qz9zs/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Children's Audiobooks","Action & Adventure"],"lastUpdate":1637046099981,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Brian Jacques/Doomwyte","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Brian Jacques/Doomwyte","addedAt":1637046098251,"lastUpdate":1637046099981,"duration":44602979,"size":354085742,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":1,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":2097.412,"title":"001"},{"id":1,"start":2097.412,"end":4271.217,"title":"002"},{"id":2,"start":4271.217,"end":6001.057,"title":"003"},{"id":3,"start":6001.057,"end":7847.926,"title":"004"},{"id":4,"start":7847.926,"end":9884.548,"title":"005"},{"id":5,"start":9884.548,"end":11915.226,"title":"006"},{"id":6,"start":11915.226,"end":14061.725,"title":"007"},{"id":7,"start":14061.725,"end":15949.554,"title":"008"},{"id":8,"start":15949.554,"end":17897.43,"title":"009"},{"id":9,"start":17897.43,"end":19883.479,"title":"010"},{"id":10,"start":19883.479,"end":22301.28,"title":"011"},{"id":11,"start":22301.28,"end":24469.977,"title":"012"},{"id":12,"start":24469.977,"end":26563.674,"title":"013"},{"id":13,"start":26563.674,"end":28591.473,"title":"014"},{"id":14,"start":28591.473,"end":30318.155,"title":"015"},{"id":15,"start":30318.155,"end":32091.184,"title":"016"},{"id":16,"start":32091.184,"end":34170.16,"title":"017"},{"id":17,"start":34170.16,"end":36108.979,"title":"018"},{"id":18,"start":36108.979,"end":38307.352,"title":"019"},{"id":19,"start":38307.352,"end":40378.897,"title":"020"},{"id":20,"start":40378.897,"end":42520.566,"title":"021"},{"id":21,"start":42520.566,"end":44602.979,"title":"022"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1r9xt3","ino":"15686175202619134116","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Dragonvein (Book One)","subtitle":null,"author":"Brian D Anderson","authorFL":"Brian D Anderson","authorLF":"Anderson, Brian D","narrator":"Derek Perkins","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2015","publisher":null,"description":"Carentan, France, 1944 - Ethan Martin, a soldier in the 101st Airborne, is fighting for his life.

In Oathbringer, the third volume of the New York Times best-selling Stormlight Archive, humanity faces a new Desolation with the return of the Voidbringers, a foe with numbers as great as their thirst for vengeance.  Dalinar Kholin's Alethi armies won a fleeting victory at a terrible cost. The enemy Parshendi summoned the violent Everstorm, which now sweeps the world with destruction and in its passing awakens the once peaceful and subservient parshmen to the horror of their millennia-long enslavement by humans. While on a desperate flight to warn his family of the threat, Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with the fact that the newly kindled anger of the parshmen may be wholly justified.  Nestled in the mountains high above the storms, in the tower city of Urithiru, Shallan Davar investigates the wonders of the ancient stronghold of the Knights Radiant and unearths dark secrets lurking in its depths. And Dalinar realizes that his holy mission to unite his homeland of Alethkar was too narrow in scope. Unless all the nations of Roshar can put aside Dalinar's blood-soaked past and stand together - and unless Dalinar himself can confront that past - even the restoration of the Knights Radiant will not prevent the end of civilization.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1tbdrb/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637050780793,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Brandon Sanderson/The Stormlight Archive 03 - Oathbringer","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Brandon Sanderson/The Stormlight Archive 03 - Oathbringer","addedAt":1637050022183,"lastUpdate":1637050780794,"duration":198376314,"size":1595564110,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":152,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":40.0,"title":"Chapter 0 (Opening Credits)"},{"id":1,"start":40.0,"end":49.0,"title":"Chapter 1 (Dedication)"},{"id":2,"start":49.0,"end":635.0,"title":"Chapter 2 (Preface and Acknowledgments)"},{"id":3,"start":635.0,"end":1926.0,"title":"Chapter 3 (Prologue: To Weep)"},{"id":4,"start":1926.0,"end":1935.0,"title":"Chapter 4 (Part One: United)"},{"id":5,"start":1935.0,"end":2950.0,"title":"Chapter 5 (1.

More than anything, Joel wants to be a Rithmatist. Chosen by the Master in a mysterious inception ceremony, Rithmatists have the power to infuse life into two-dimensional figures known as Chalklings. Rithmatists are humanity’s only defense against the Wild Chalklings - merciless creatures that leave mangled corpses in their wake. Having nearly overrun the territory of Nebrask, the Wild Chalklings now threaten all of the American Isles. As the son of a lowly chalkmaker at Armedius Academy, Joel can only watch as Rithmatist students study the magical art that he would do anything to practice. Then students start disappearing - kidnapped from their rooms at night, leaving trails of blood. Assigned to help the professor who is investigating the crimes, Joel and his friend Melody find themselves on the trail of an unexpected discovery - one that will change Rithmatics - and their world - forever. Best-selling author Brandon Sanderson brings his unique brand of epic storytelling to the teen audience with an engrossing tale of danger and suspense - the first of a series. With his trademark skills in world-building, Sanderson has created a magic system that is so inventive and detailed that listeners who appreciate games of strategy and tactics just may want to bring Rithmatics to life in our world.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1u2xgx/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Children's Audiobooks","Science Fiction & Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637051312545,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Brandon Sanderson/The Rithmatist","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Brandon Sanderson/The Rithmatist","addedAt":1637051307060,"lastUpdate":1637051312545,"duration":37574808,"size":663083750,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":2,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":18879.696,"title":"The Rithmatist 1"},{"id":1,"start":18879.696,"end":37574.808000000005,"title":"The Rithmatist 2"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1u7ke2","ino":"15010935292056571750","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Skyward","subtitle":null,"author":"Brandon Sanderson","authorFL":"Brandon Sanderson","authorLF":"Sanderson, Brandon","narrator":"Suzy Jackson","series":"Skyward","volumeNumber":"1","publishYear":"2018","publisher":null,"description":"\"Narrator Suzy Jackson's assured, brassy tones and forceful delivery are an exceptional match for Sanderson's high-stakes, battle-driven space opera.... Jackson's gift for characterizations shines - she brings out the humor and heroism in Spensa's young classmates and friends (and the neurotic spaceship MBOT), along with the pain and perseverance of the generations that came before them. This is a high-octane futuristic narrative of hope, sacrifice, and courage, and a fast pace speaks to the rising urgency as war rages above the planet. Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award.\" (AudioFile magazine) From Brandon Sanderson, the number one New York Times best-selling author of the Reckoners series, Words of Radiance, and the internationally best-selling Mistborn series, comes the first book in an epic new series about a girl who dreams of becoming a pilot in a dangerous world at war for humanity's future.   Spensa's world has been under attack for decades. Now pilots are the heroes of what's left of the human race, and becoming one has always been Spensa's dream. Since she was a little girl, she has imagined soaring skyward and proving her bravery. But her fate is intertwined with her father's - a pilot himself who was killed years ago when he abruptly deserted his team, leaving Spensa's chances of attending flight school at slim to none.   No one will let Spensa forget what her father did, yet fate works in mysterious ways. Flight school might be a long shot, but she is determined to fly. And an accidental discovery in a long-forgotten cavern might just provide her with a way to claim the stars.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1u7ke2/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Teen & Young Adult","Literature &

Kramer","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2007","publisher":null,"description":"From number one New York Times best-selling author Brandon Sanderson, the Mistborn series is a heist story of political intrigue and magical martial-arts action.  The impossible has been accomplished. The Lord Ruler - the man who claimed to be god incarnate and brutally ruled the world for a thousand years - has been vanquished. But Kelsier, the hero who masterminded that triumph, is dead too, and now the awesome task of building a new world has been left to his young protégé, Vin, the former street urchin who is now the most powerful Mistborn in the land, and to the idealistic young nobleman she loves.  As Kelsier's protégé and slayer of the Lord Ruler she is now venerated by a budding new religion, a distinction that makes her intensely uncomfortable. Even more worrying, the mists have begun behaving strangely since the Lord Ruler died, and seem to harbor a strange vaporous entity that haunts her. Stopping assassins may keep Vin's Mistborn skills sharp, but it's the least of her problems. Luthadel, the largest city of the former empire, doesn't run itself, and Vin and the other members of Kelsier's crew, who lead the revolution, must learn a whole new set of practical and political skills to help. It certainly won't get easier with three armies - one of them composed of ferocious giants - now vying to conquer the city, and no sign of the Lord Ruler's hidden cache of atium, the rarest and most powerful allomantic metal. As the siege of Luthadel tightens, an ancient legend seems to offer a glimmer of hope. But even if it really exists, no one knows where to find the Well of Ascension or what manner of power it bestows.  Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson: The Cosmere The Stormlight Archive The Way of Kings Words of Radiance Edgedancer (Novella) Oathbringer  The Mistborn trilogy Mistborn: The Final Empire The Well of Ascension The Hero of Ages Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series: Alloy of Law Shadows of Self Bands of Mourning Collection Arcanum Unbounded Other Cosmere novels: Elantris Warbreaker The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series: Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians The Scrivener's Bones The Knights of Crystallia The Shattered Lens The Dark Talent The Rithmatist series: The Rithmatist Other books by Brandon Sanderson: The Reckoners Steelheart Firefight Calamity","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1vp5d6/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637054186190,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Brandon Sanderson/Mistborn 02 - Well Of Ascension","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Brandon Sanderson/Mistborn 02 - Well Of Ascension","addedAt":1637054023385,"lastUpdate":1637054186190,"duration":104233788,"size":847028498,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":26,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":4318.496,"title":"Well of Ascension 01-26"},{"id":1,"start":4318.496,"end":8643.721000000001,"title":"Well of Ascension 02-26"},{"id":2,"start":8643.721000000001,"end":12972.081000000002,"title":"Well of Ascension 03-26"},{"id":3,"start":12972.081000000002,"end":17293.936,"title":"Well of Ascension 04-26"},{"id":4,"start":17293.936,"end":21619.239,"title":"Well of Ascension 05-26"},{"id":5,"start":21619.239,"end":25940.807,"title":"Well of Ascension 06-26"},{"id":6,"start":25940.807,"end":26945.855,"title":"Well of Ascension 07-26"},{"id":7,"start":26945.855,"end":31267.153,"title":"Well of Ascension 08-26"},{"id":8,"start":31267.153,"end":35593.684,"title":"Well of Ascension 09-26"},{"id":9,"start":35593.684,"end":39920.058000000005,"title":"Well of Ascension 10-26"},{"id":10,"start":39920.058000000005,"end":44245.361000000004,"title":"Well of Ascension 11-26"},{"id":11,"start":44245.361000000004,"end":48570.351,"title":"Well of Ascension 12-26"},{"id":12,"start":48570.351,"end":52893.538,"title":"Well of Ascension 13-26"},{"id":13,"start":52893.538,"end":54702.334,"title":"Well of Ascension 14-26"},{"id":14,"start":54702.334,"end":59016.363000000005,"title":"Well of Ascension 15-26"},{"id":15,"start":59016.363000000005,"end":63338.114,"title":"Well of Ascension 16-26"},{"id":16,"start":63338.114,"end":67662.32,"title":"Well of Ascension 17-26"},{"id":17,"start":67662.32,"end":72002.25200000001,"title":"Well of Ascension 18-26"},{"id":18,"start":72002.25200000001,"end":76323.872,"title":"Well of Ascension 19-26"},{"id":19,"start":76323.872,"end":80650.011,"title":"Well of Ascension 20-26"},{"id":20,"start":80650.011,"end":82684.707,"title":"Well of Ascension 21-26"},{"id":21,"start":82684.707,"end":86993.167,"title":"Well of Ascension 22-26"},{"id":22,"start":86993.167,"end":91316.459,"title":"Well of Ascension 23-26"},{"id":23,"start":91316.459,"end":95639.568,"title":"Well of Ascension 24-26"},{"id":24,"start":95639.568,"end":99971.872,"title":"Well of Ascension 25-26"},{"id":25,"start":99971.872,"end":104233.788,"title":"Well of Ascension 26-26"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1wq45u","ino":"4812202781720835129","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"The Elven","subtitle":null,"author":"Bernhard Hennen","authorFL":"Bernhard Hennen","authorLF":"Hennen, Bernhard","narrator":"Michael Page","series":"Saga of the Elven","volumeNumber":"1","publishYear":"2004","publisher":null,"description":"The international bestseller and epic adventure A fierce and merciless demon has been unleashed on the world, spreading destruction and bloodshed in both the human and the elven realms.

In mage society I was an unknown and, all in all, that was how I liked it. It’s hard to say what changed. Whatever it was, I got involved in the magical world again and started getting myself a reputation. Alex Verus’s insights into the future used to be the best-kept secret in London. Now, with the aid of his apprentice, Luna, his unique investigative talents are all the rage. He just has to be careful about picking his employers, because everyone - even the beautiful woman who practically begs him to run security for a prestigious tournament - has motives that can be hard to predict. And Alex doesn’t do unpredictable. But his latest gig just might be impossible. Apprentices have been vanishing without a trace - and someone on the Council could be involved. Alex has no evidence, no witnesses, and no suspects. All he knows is that someone is keeping tabs on him. And after assassins target Luna’s classmate, Alex sees that he doesn’t know the half of it - and that he could be the next to disappear.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1x4o21/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637056781237,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Benedict Jacka/Taken (2012)","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Benedict Jacka/Taken (2012)","addedAt":1637056427082,"lastUpdate":1637056781237,"duration":36407608,"size":445814128,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":40,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":901.258,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 01-40"},{"id":1,"start":901.258,"end":1820.899,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 02-40"},{"id":2,"start":1820.899,"end":2735.29,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 03-40"},{"id":3,"start":2735.29,"end":3638.84,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 04-40"},{"id":4,"start":3638.84,"end":4548.215,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 05-40"},{"id":5,"start":4548.215,"end":5455.866,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 06-40"},{"id":6,"start":5455.866,"end":6375.429,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 07-40"},{"id":7,"start":6375.429,"end":7288.827,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 08-40"},{"id":8,"start":7288.827,"end":8191.175,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 09-40"},{"id":9,"start":8191.175,"end":9099.688,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 10-40"},{"id":10,"start":9099.688,"end":10032.939,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 11-40"},{"id":11,"start":10032.939,"end":10975.960000000001,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 12-40"},{"id":12,"start":10975.960000000001,"end":11896.098000000002,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 13-40"},{"id":13,"start":11896.098000000002,"end":12804.977000000003,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 14-40"},{"id":14,"start":12804.977000000003,"end":13730.417000000003,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 15-40"},{"id":15,"start":13730.417000000003,"end":14696.008000000003,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 16-40"},{"id":16,"start":14696.008000000003,"end":15599.480000000003,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 17-40"},{"id":17,"start":15599.480000000003,"end":16523.510000000002,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 18-40"},{"id":18,"start":16523.510000000002,"end":17480.742000000002,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 19-40"},{"id":19,"start":17480.742000000002,"end":18399.182,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 20-40"},{"id":20,"start":18399.182,"end":19309.21,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 21-40"},{"id":21,"start":19309.21,"end":20233.553,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 22-40"},{"id":22,"start":20233.553,"end":21141.544,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 23-40"},{"id":23,"start":21141.544,"end":22059.043,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 24-40"},{"id":24,"start":22059.043,"end":22969.306,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 25-40"},{"id":25,"start":22969.306,"end":23878.603,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 26-40"},{"id":26,"start":23878.603,"end":24815.198,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 27-40"},{"id":27,"start":24815.198,"end":25725.305,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 28-40"},{"id":28,"start":25725.305,"end":26639.356,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 29-40"},{"id":29,"start":26639.356,"end":27544.525,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 30-40"},{"id":30,"start":27544.525,"end":28458.498,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 31-40"},{"id":31,"start":28458.498,"end":29361.943,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 32-40"},{"id":32,"start":29361.943,"end":30270.482,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 33-40"},{"id":33,"start":30270.482,"end":31183.985,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 34-40"},{"id":34,"start":31183.985,"end":32095.345,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 35-40"},{"id":35,"start":32095.345,"end":33011.329,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 36-40"},{"id":36,"start":33011.329,"end":33927.051999999996,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 37-40"},{"id":37,"start":33927.051999999996,"end":34851.708999999995,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 38-40"},{"id":38,"start":34851.708999999995,"end":35763.460999999996,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 39-40"},{"id":39,"start":35763.460999999996,"end":36407.60799999999,"title":"Benedict Jacka - Taken 40-40"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1xc98r","ino":"1921624522592373391","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Marked","subtitle":null,"author":"Benedict Jacka","authorFL":"Benedict Jacka","authorLF":"Jacka, Benedict","narrator":"Gildart Jackson","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2018","publisher":null,"description":"Mage Alex Verus is hanging on by a thread in the ninth urban fantasy novel from the national best-selling author of Burned.

Hide something behind smoke and mirrors and make people work to find it, and they'll tear the place down looking for what's there. Alex Verus is a diviner who can see probable futures-a talent that's gotten him out of many a tough scrape. But this time, he may be in over his head. Alex was once apprenticed to a Dark mage, and in his service he did a lot of things he isn't proud of.

An immortal mage. Soul-drinking daemons. A trickster god with chaos in mind. And a girl with the future of the world in her hands. The Forever King is the start of an epic, blood-soaked fantasy saga. In Emaneska, to consort with magick is to court death. Banned by the Arka Empire, magick's purging has finally brought peace to war-torn Emaneska. Like any dutiful citizen, Mithrid Fenn wants nothing to do with magick. But when an illegal spellbook washes up on a beach after a battle between giant, unknown ships, Mithrid Fenn is thrust into a war she never knew existed. Her family slaughtered, Mithrid finds herself hunted by daemons and the emperor's assassins. She is dragged inexorably north to Scalussen, where mages, dragons, beast-people, and witches doggedly wage a war for freedom against the tyrannical empire. But Mithrid only cares for revenge and nothing nobler. If killing the emperor means helping the Outlaw King, then so be it. Even if it means drowning the world in fire.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1ydfah/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637058690908,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Ben Galley/The Forever King","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Ben Galley/The Forever King","addedAt":1637058515349,"lastUpdate":1637058690909,"duration":85514656,"size":1359746784,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":43,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":16.0,"title":"Chapter 0 (Opening Credits)"},{"id":1,"start":16.0,"end":262.0,"title":"Chapter 1 (A Note)"},{"id":2,"start":262.0,"end":267.0,"title":"Chapter 2 (Part One: Hollow Peace)"},{"id":3,"start":267.0,"end":2166.0,"title":"Chapter 3 (1.

Peter Grant is learning magic fast. And it's just as well - he's already had run-ins with the deadly supernatural children of the Thames and a terrifying killer in Soho. Progression in the Police Force is less easy. Especially when you work in a department of two. A department that doesn't even officially exist. A department that if you did describe it to most people would get you laughed at. And then there's his love life. The last person he fell for ended up seriously dead. It wasn't his fault, but still. Now something horrible is happening in the labyrinth of tunnels that make up the tube system that honeycombs the ancient foundations of London. And delays on the Northern line is the very least of it. Time to call in the Met's Economic and Specialist Crime Unit 9, aka 'The Folly'. Time to call in PC Peter Grant, Britain's Last Wizard.

Peter Grant is facing fatherhood and an uncertain future with equal amounts of panic and enthusiasm. Rather than sit around, he takes a job with émigré Silicon Valley tech genius Terrence Skinner's brand-new London start-up - the Serious Cybernetics Company.  Drawn into the orbit of Old Street's famous 'silicon roundabout', Peter must learn how to blend in with people who are both civilians and geekier than he is. Compared to his last job, Peter thinks it should be a doddle. But magic is not finished with Mama Grant's favourite son.  Because Terrence Skinner has a secret hidden in the bowels of the SCC. A technology that stretches back to Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage and forward to the future of artificial intelligence. A secret that is just as magical as it technological - and just as dangerous.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1zb4nk/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Crime Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637060362705,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Ben Aaronovitch/False Value","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Ben Aaronovitch/False Value","addedAt":1637060087937,"lastUpdate":1637060362705,"duration":39870894,"size":354764068,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":28,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":22.519,"title":"001 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":1,"start":22.519,"end":49.087,"title":"002 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":2,"start":49.087,"end":86.94,"title":"003 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":3,"start":86.94,"end":2142.831,"title":"004 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":4,"start":2142.831,"end":4563.13,"title":"005 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":5,"start":4563.13,"end":5819.674,"title":"006 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":6,"start":5819.674,"end":8160.665,"title":"007 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":7,"start":8160.665,"end":10492.827,"title":"008 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":8,"start":10492.827,"end":12002.471,"title":"009 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":9,"start":12002.471,"end":12045.939999999999,"title":"010 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":10,"start":12045.939999999999,"end":14068.498,"title":"011 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":11,"start":14068.498,"end":15965.145999999999,"title":"012 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":12,"start":15965.145999999999,"end":17451.619,"title":"013 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":13,"start":17451.619,"end":19543.271,"title":"014 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":14,"start":19543.271,"end":19572.895,"title":"015 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":15,"start":19572.895,"end":21207.221,"title":"016 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":16,"start":21207.221,"end":22861.897,"title":"017 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":17,"start":22861.897,"end":25354.477,"title":"018 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":18,"start":25354.477,"end":27821.796,"title":"019 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":19,"start":27821.796,"end":29594.936999999998,"title":"020 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":20,"start":29594.936999999998,"end":29628.218999999997,"title":"021 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":21,"start":29628.218999999997,"end":30855.871,"title":"022 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":22,"start":30855.871,"end":32376.094999999998,"title":"023 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":23,"start":32376.094999999998,"end":34238.888,"title":"024 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":24,"start":34238.888,"end":36979.343,"title":"025 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":25,"start":36979.343,"end":38067.527,"title":"026 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":26,"start":38067.527,"end":38140.724,"title":"027 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"},{"id":27,"start":38140.724,"end":39870.894,"title":"028 Ben Aaronovitch (2020) False Value"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1zjj5g","ino":"13779941472069037401","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Milkman","subtitle":null,"author":"Anna Burns","authorFL":"Anna Burns","authorLF":"Burns, Anna","narrator":"Bríd Brennan","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2018","publisher":null,"description":"In this unnamed city, to be interesting is dangerous.

Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. Now, he's sure he'll be the first person to die there. After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive - and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. Chances are, though, he won't have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain old \"human error\" are much more likely to kill him first. But Mark isn't ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills - and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit - he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him? Wil Wheaton, who has lent his voice to sci-fi blockbusters like Ready Player One and Redshirts, breathes new life (and plenty of sarcasm) into the iconic character of Mark Watney, making this edition a must-listen for both longtime fans of The Martian and new listeners alike. BONUS MATERIAL: This edition includes the following extras: “Diary of an AssCan” - Mark Watney, new astronaut “I Made It!” - A happy letter to Mom “Car Trouble” - A somewhat sad letter to Mom “The Earthling” - A postscript. *Available for the first time in this recording","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1zkh0y/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Science Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637060758650,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Andy Weir/The Martian (2011)","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Andy Weir/The Martian (2011)","addedAt":1637060524382,"lastUpdate":1637060758650,"duration":37715028,"size":309155203,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":19,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":1992.516,"title":"Andy Weir - The Martain Track 01"},{"id":1,"start":1992.516,"end":4058.123,"title":"Andy Weir - The Martain Track 02"},{"id":2,"start":4058.123,"end":6137.888,"title":"Andy Weir - The Martain Track 03"},{"id":3,"start":6137.888,"end":8105.353,"title":"Andy Weir - The Martain Track 04"},{"id":4,"start":8105.353,"end":10200.922,"title":"Andy Weir - The Martain Track 05"},{"id":5,"start":10200.922,"end":12137.719000000001,"title":"Andy Weir - The Martain Track 06"},{"id":6,"start":12137.719000000001,"end":14194.079000000002,"title":"Andy Weir - The Martain Track 07"},{"id":7,"start":14194.079000000002,"end":16235.549,"title":"Andy Weir - The Martain Track 08"},{"id":8,"start":16235.549,"end":18187.132,"title":"Andy Weir - The Martain Track 09"},{"id":9,"start":18187.132,"end":20300.439000000002,"title":"Andy Weir - The Martain Track 10"},{"id":10,"start":20300.439000000002,"end":22250.977000000003,"title":"Andy Weir - The Martain Track 11"},{"id":11,"start":22250.977000000003,"end":24319.484000000004,"title":"Andy Weir - The Martain Track 12"},{"id":12,"start":24319.484000000004,"end":26415.315000000002,"title":"Andy Weir - The Martain Track 13"},{"id":13,"start":26415.315000000002,"end":28427.267000000003,"title":"Andy Weir - The Martain Track 14"},{"id":14,"start":28427.267000000003,"end":30414.585000000003,"title":"Andy Weir - The Martain Track 15"},{"id":15,"start":30414.585000000003,"end":32480.532000000003,"title":"Andy Weir - The Martain Track 16"},{"id":16,"start":32480.532000000003,"end":34484.490000000005,"title":"Andy Weir - The Martain Track 17"},{"id":17,"start":34484.490000000005,"end":36559.94500000001,"title":"Andy Weir - The Martain Track 18"},{"id":18,"start":36559.94500000001,"end":37715.028000000006,"title":"Andy Weir - The Martain Track 19"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1zx4o4","ino":"6978258959247585879","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Sufficiently Advanced Magic","subtitle":null,"author":"Andrew Rowe","authorFL":"Andrew Rowe","authorLF":"Rowe, Andrew","narrator":"Nick Podehl","series":"Arcane Ascension","volumeNumber":"1","publishYear":"2017","publisher":null,"description":"Five years ago Corin Cadence's brother entered the Serpent Spire - a colossal tower with ever-shifting rooms, traps, and monsters.

Keras Selyrian is already well on the way to cutting his name into the annals of legend. He’s fought false divinities, thieving sorcerers, and corrupt demigods - and left them defeated in his wake. But he’s a long way from home, and Kaldwyn offers a different brand of danger than he’s used to. He’s already got a sword of unfathomable power, but it’s damaged and leaking world-annihilating mana, so he’s in the market for a new one. Possibly six. The more the better, really. The Six Sacred Swords are Kaldwyn’s most famous artifacts, forged as the only means to defeat the god beasts. Each sword must be earned by a worthy champion, and no single person has ever managed to collect them all. Not yet, at least. Keras is just getting started. Six Sacred Swords is a lighthearted fantasy adventure inspired by Japanese game series like The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Fire Emblem. It takes place in the same universe as the Arcane Ascension novels, but years earlier and with a different protagonist.

Each time, civilizations are ground to dust beneath the Demon King's hordes, but humanity has remained secure in the belief that a Hero of legend will always save them. There's just one slight problem. It's only been 23 years since the Demon King's latest rise, and this time, he's already conquered more than half the world. If humanity simply waits for the Hero's return, there may be no world left for him to save. And so, Yui Shaw sets out with an ambitious plan. A 10-step plan. She'll find a way to obtain the Hero's legendary sword. She'll earn obscure classes, gain levels, and increase her skills. She'll travel to the meticulously-crafted dungeons that seem designed for one specific Hero to complete. And, if she's truly (un)fortunate, she might even find a fairy. She might not be a Hero - but if she can fake it long enough, she might still be able to save the world.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw203e8k/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637061449182,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Andrew Rowe/How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Andrew Rowe/How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps","addedAt":1637061407399,"lastUpdate":1637061449182,"duration":19696845,"size":314810225,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":15,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":15.163,"title":"Opening Credits"},{"id":1,"start":15.163,"end":36.317,"title":"Dedication"},{"id":2,"start":36.317,"end":818.4350000000001,"title":"Step One Be the Legendary Chosen Hero"},{"id":3,"start":818.4350000000001,"end":1605.778,"title":"Step Two Unlock Your Latent Heroic Power"},{"id":4,"start":1605.778,"end":2673.7110000000002,"title":"Step Three Obtain the Hero’s Sword"},{"id":5,"start":2673.7110000000002,"end":4156.05,"title":"Step Four Find the Most Powerful Monsters Available"},{"id":6,"start":4156.05,"end":5023.85,"title":"Step Five Defeat the Deadly Monsters to Increase Your Abilities"},{"id":7,"start":5023.85,"end":8044.813,"title":"Step Six Use the Traditional Steps to Defeat Each Dungeon"},{"id":8,"start":8044.813,"end":10620.092,"title":"Step Seven Wait, You Forgot to Recruit Loyal Companions, Do That"},{"id":9,"start":10620.092,"end":14968.354,"title":"Step Eight Okay, Now Clear the Remaining Dungeons in the Proper Order"},{"id":10,"start":14968.354,"end":16047.037,"title":"Step Nine Prepare for the Final Battle"},{"id":11,"start":16047.037,"end":18293.313000000002,"title":"Step Ten Defeat the Demon King"},{"id":12,"start":18293.313000000002,"end":19329.063000000002,"title":"Step Eleven There Were Only Ten Steps, What Went Wrong"},{"id":13,"start":19329.063000000002,"end":19654.050000000003,"title":"Epilogue Find a New Goal"},{"id":14,"start":19654.050000000003,"end":19696.845,"title":"End Credits"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw20xy1z","ino":"14015728712537296482","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Weight of the Crown","subtitle":null,"author":"AC Cobble","authorFL":"AC Cobble","authorLF":"Cobble, AC","narrator":"Eric Michael Summerer","series":"Benjamin Ashwood Series","volumeNumber":"6","publishYear":"2018","publisher":null,"description":"AC Cobble presents the epic conclusion to the Benjamin Ashwood series.   Ben and his friends have defeated a deadly threat to mankind and gained powerful allies along the way, but sometimes, the biggest danger is ourselves.  In the final audiobook in the Benjamin Ashwood series, Ben will have to take the mantle of leadership to prevent a war that will devastate Alcott.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw20xy1z/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Action & Adventure"],"lastUpdate":1637062901903,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"AC Cobble/Weight of the Crown","fullPath":"/audiobooks/AC Cobble/Weight of the Crown","addedAt":1637062832525,"lastUpdate":1637062901903,"duration":50768442,"size":405257681,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":18,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":14.165,"title":"Opening Credits"},{"id":1,"start":14.165,"end":1291.263,"title":"1.

Named one of the best books of the year by NPR, Tordotcom, and Kirkus Reviews. A soldier with a curse Tala lost her family to the empress' army and has spent her life avenging them in battle. But the empress' crimes don’t haunt her half as much as the crimes Tala has committed against the laws of magic...and against her own flesh and blood. A prince with a debt Jimuro has inherited the ashes of an empire. Now that the revolution has brought down his kingdom, he must depend on Tala to bring him home safe. But it was his army who murdered her family. Now Tala will be his redemption - or his downfall. A detective with a grudge Xiulan is an eccentric, pipe-smoking detective who can solve any mystery - but the biggest mystery of all is her true identity. She’s a princess in disguise, and she plans to secure her throne by presenting her father with the ultimate prize: the world’s most-wanted prince. A thief with a broken heart Lee is a small-time criminal who lives by only one law: Leave them before they leave you. But when Princess Xiulan asks her to be her partner in crime - and offers her a magical animal companion as a reward - she can’t say no, and she soon finds she doesn’t want to leave the princess behind. This band of rogues and royals should all be enemies, but they unite for a common purpose: to defeat an unstoppable killer who defies the laws of magic. In this battle, they will forge unexpected bonds of friendship and love that will change their lives - and begin to change the world.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw21d60t/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Paul Krueger/Steel Crow Saga/Paul Krueger (2019) Steel Crow Saga

In a land where three suns almost never set, a fledgling killer joins a school of assassins, seeking vengeance against the powers who destroyed her family. Daughter of an executed traitor, Mia Corvere is barely able to escape her father's failed rebellion with her life. Alone and friendless, she hides in a city built from the bones of a dead god, hunted by the Senate and her father's former comrades. But her gift for speaking with the shadows leads her to the door of a retired killer and a future she never imagined. Now, 16-year-old Mia is apprenticed to the deadliest flock of assassins in the entire Republic - the Red Church. Treachery and trials await her within the Church's halls, and to fail is to die. But if she survives to initiation, Mia will be inducted among the chosen of the Lady of Blessed Murder and be one step closer to the only thing she desires: revenge.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw24grcq/Nevernight The Nevernight Chronicle, Book 1 (Unabridged).jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Jay Kristoff/Nevernight Chronicles/01 -

The dictatorial Augurs, once thought of almost as gods, were overthrown and wiped out during the conflict, their much-feared powers mysteriously failing them. Those who had ruled under them, men and women with a lesser ability known as the Gift, avoided the Augurs' fate only by submitting themselves to the rebellion's Four Tenets. A representation of these laws is now written into the flesh of any who use the Gift, forcing those so marked into absolute obedience. As a student of the Gifted, Davian suffers the consequences of a war fought--and lost--before he was born. Despised by most beyond the school walls, he and those around him are all but prisoners as they attempt to learn control of the Gift. Worse, as Davian struggles with his lessons, he knows there is further to fall if he cannot pass his final tests. But when he discovers he has the ability to wield the forbidden power of the Augurs, he sets into motion a chain of events that will change everything. To the north an ancient enemy, long thought defeated, begins to stir.

The Orb of Aldur was restored. And once again, with the crowning of Garion, there was a descendant of Riva Iron-grip to rule as Overlord of the West. And yet the prophecy was unfulfilled. In the east, the evil god Torak was about to awaken and seek dominion. Somehow, Garion had to face the god, to kill or be killed. On the outcome of that dread duel rested the destiny of the world. Now, accompanied by his grandfather, the ancient sorcerer Belgarath, Garion heads toward the City of Endless Night, where Torak awaits him. To the south, his young fiancée, the Imperial Princess Ce'Nedra, leads the armies of the West in a desperate effort to divert the forces of Torak's horde away from the man she loved. The prophecy drives Garion on, but it gives no answer to the question that haunts him. How does a man kill an immortal god? He must answer that question in this resolution of the epic war between men, kings and gods that has spanned 7,000 years.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw24xldw/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction &

Prophecy also speaks of a time when he will again awaken to seek dominance over all the world. Now the Orb has been stolen by a priest of Torak, and that time is at hand. Belgarath the Sorcerer and his daughter, Polgara the arch-Sorceress, are on the trail of the Orb, seeking to regain it before the final disaster. With them goes Garion, a simple farm boy only months before, but now the focus of the struggle. He had never believed in sorcery, wanting no part of it. Yet with every league they travel, the power is growing within him, forcing him into acts of wizardry that he can't accept. His fate is inextricably woven into the fabric of an unfolding prophecy for glory or doom.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw25qctf/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637070941944,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"David Eddings/The Belgariad/02 - Queen of Sorcery","fullPath":"/audiobooks/David Eddings/The Belgariad/02 - Queen of Sorcery","addedAt":1637070875782,"lastUpdate":1637070941944,"duration":45436479,"size":368746691,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":12,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":3986.338,"title":"Queen of Sorcery - 01 of 12"},{"id":1,"start":3986.338,"end":7985.868,"title":"Queen of Sorcery - 02 of 12"},{"id":2,"start":7985.868,"end":11951.7,"title":"Queen of Sorcery - 03 of 12"},{"id":3,"start":11951.7,"end":15946.189,"title":"Queen of Sorcery - 04 of 12"},{"id":4,"start":15946.189,"end":19934.461,"title":"Queen of Sorcery - 05 of 12"},{"id":5,"start":19934.461,"end":23935.663,"title":"Queen of Sorcery - 06 of 12"},{"id":6,"start":23935.663,"end":27965.13,"title":"Queen of Sorcery - 07 of 12"},{"id":7,"start":27965.13,"end":31935.273,"title":"Queen of Sorcery - 08 of 12"},{"id":8,"start":31935.273,"end":35954.891,"title":"Queen of Sorcery - 09 of 12"},{"id":9,"start":35954.891,"end":39923.022000000004,"title":"Queen of Sorcery - 10 of 12"},{"id":10,"start":39923.022000000004,"end":43512.03800000001,"title":"Queen of Sorcery - 11 of 12"},{"id":11,"start":43512.03800000001,"end":45436.47900000001,"title":"Queen of Sorcery - 12 of 12"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw25rrbb","ino":"1007092323226444555","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"01","subtitle":"Pawn of Prophecy","author":"David Eddings","authorFL":"David Eddings","authorLF":"Eddings, David","narrator":"Cameron Beierle","series":"The Belgariad","volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2003","publisher":null,"description":"Long ago, so the Storyteller claimed, the evil god Torak sought dominion and drove men and gods to war. But Belgrath the Sorcerer led men to reclaim the Orb that protected the West. So long as it lay at Riva, the prophecy went, men would be safe. That was only a story, and Garion did not believe in magic dooms, even though the man without a shadow had haunted him for years. Brought up on a quiet farm by his Aunt Pol, how could he know that the Apostate planned to wake dread Torak, or that he would be led on a quest of unparalleled magic and danger by those he loved, but did not truly know. For yet a little while, his dreams of innocence remained safe, untroubled by knowledge of his strange heritage. For a little while... thus begins The Belgariad, an epic fantasy of immense scope set against a history of 7,000 years. It tells of the struggles between ancient gods and mighty Kings, and of men in strange lands facing fated events, all bound by a prophecy that must be fulfilled.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw25rrbb/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637070994692,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"David Eddings/The Belgariad/01 - Pawn of Prophecy","fullPath":"/audiobooks/David Eddings/The Belgariad/01 - Pawn of Prophecy","addedAt":1637070941955,"lastUpdate":1637070994692,"duration":37633859,"size":305441536,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":10,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":3807.765,"title":"David Eddings - Belgariad Bk1 -  Pawn of Prophecy - 01 of 10"},{"id":1,"start":3807.765,"end":7598.316,"title":"David Eddings - Belgariad Bk1 -  Pawn of Prophecy - 02 of 10"},{"id":2,"start":7598.316,"end":11385.993,"title":"David Eddings - Belgariad Bk1 -  Pawn of Prophecy - 03 of 10"},{"id":3,"start":11385.993,"end":15168.916000000001,"title":"David Eddings - Belgariad Bk1 -  Pawn of Prophecy - 04 of 10"},{"id":4,"start":15168.916000000001,"end":18961.765,"title":"David Eddings - Belgariad Bk1 -  Pawn of Prophecy - 05 of 10"},{"id":5,"start":18961.765,"end":22746.725,"title":"David Eddings - Belgariad Bk1 -  Pawn of Prophecy - 06 of 10"},{"id":6,"start":22746.725,"end":26549.239999999998,"title":"David Eddings - Belgariad Bk1 -  Pawn of Prophecy - 07 of 10"},{"id":7,"start":26549.239999999998,"end":30366.435999999998,"title":"David Eddings - Belgariad Bk1 -  Pawn of Prophecy - 08 of 10"},{"id":8,"start":30366.435999999998,"end":34182.873999999996,"title":"David Eddings - Belgariad Bk1 -  Pawn of Prophecy - 09 of 10"},{"id":9,"start":34182.873999999996,"end":37633.859,"title":"David Eddings - Belgariad Bk1 -  Pawn of Prophecy - 10 of 10"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw26a6gi","ino":"5727293016883570365","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"02","subtitle":"The Providence of Fire","author":"Brian Staveley","authorFL":"Brian Staveley","authorLF":"Staveley, Brian","narrator":"Simon Vance","series":"The Unhewn Throne","volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2014","publisher":null,"description":"Brian Staveley's The Providence of Fire, the second novel in the Chronicle of the Unhewn Throne, a gripping new epic fantasy series in the tradition of Brandon Sanderson and George R.

Few trust her, but when she is believed to be touched by Intarra, patron goddess of the empire, the people rally to help her retake the capital city. As armies prepare to clash, the threat of invasion from barbarian hordes compels the rival forces to unite against their common enemy. Unknown to Adare, her brother Valyn, renegade member of the empire's most elite fighting force, has allied with the invading nomads. The terrible choices each of them has made may make war between them inevitable. Between Valyn and Adare is their brother Kaden, rightful heir to the Unhewn Throne, who has infiltrated the Annurian capital with the help of two strange companions. The knowledge they possess of the secret history that shapes these events could save Annur or destroy it.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw26a6gi/BSPFXX-53 Brian Staveley - The Providence of Fire.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Brian Staveley/The Unhewn Throne/02 -

Tamas's invasion of Kez ends in disaster when a Kez counter-offensive leaves him cut off behind enemy lines with only a fraction of his army, no supplies and no hope of reinforcements. Drastically outnumbered and pursued by the enemy's best, he must lead his men on a reckless march through northern Kez to safety, and back over the mountains so that he can defend his country from an angry god. In Adro, Inspector Adamat only wants to rescue his wife. To do so he must track down and confront the evil Lord Vetas. He has questions for Vetas concerning his enigmatic master, but the answers might come too quickly. With Tamas and his powder cabal presumed dead, Taniel Two-shot finds himself alongside the god Mihali as the last line of defence against Kresimir's advancing army. Tamas's generals bicker among themselves, the brigades lose ground every day beneath the Kez onslaught and Kresimir wants the head of the man who shot him in the eye.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw26th42/BMCCXX-45 Brian McClellan -

When does an empire fall? The Seven Satrapies have collapsed into four - and those are falling before the White King's armies. Gavin Guile, ex-emperor, ex-Prism, ex-galley slave, formerly the one man who might have averted war, is now lost, broken, and trapped in a prison crafted by his own hands to hold a great magical genius. But Gavin has no magic at all. Worse, in this prison Gavin may not be alone. Kip Guile will make a last desperate attempt to stop the White King's growing horde. Karris White attempts to knit together an empire falling apart, helped only by her murderous and possibly treasonous father-in-law, Andross Guile. Meanwhile Teia's new talents will find a darker use - and the cost might be too much to bear. Together they will fight to prevent a tainted empire from becoming something even worse.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw27e509/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction &

What he finds is Zayda Yond.  Ever since Zayda was sold into servitude by her financially destitute father, her masters have taught her a punishing lesson: erase the past. Collared with an unmovable band of exotic metal, she faces a future of slavery. She’s also become an ink mage, marked with a tattoo that enables her to experience the world as no one else can - a powerful honor, yet one out of her control. Now, Zayda dreams only of escape.  She gets her chance when a scuttled ocean passage leaves her in a longboat, and in the company of another lone survivor, Peyne, a foreign envoy - spoiled, noble, a libertine, and a gambler. He’s also a skilled fighter. And when they make it to land, in wild and unfamiliar jungle territory, he’s the only person Zayda can trust.  Then come rumors of a lost desert city said to hold the key to removing Zayda’s collar. Shadowed by enemies who want to use her power to win their own war, Zayda must fight for her freedom - whatever the cost.

Arthur Leywin has experienced two lifetimes of challenge and adventure. He has lived as a swordsman, a mage, an adventurer, and a king. Now his two lives, old and new, will collide, revealing the connection between King Grey and Arthur Leywin, but at what cost? How will this affect the ongoing war between the nations of Alacrya and Dicathen? Enemy forces threaten the coastal cities, the elven forests, and the fortified mountain passes. Dicathen’s most powerful allies have vanished, and the military alliance between men, elves, and dwarves threatens collapse.

arrived! Join the hundreds of thousands of fans who have fallen in love with TurtleMe's reincarnation epic fantasy and main character Arthur Leywin, voiced by the talented Travis Baldree. I had to accept that I wasn’t just Arthur Leywin anymore, and that I could no longer be limited by the circumstances of my birth. If I was going to escape, if I was going to go toe-to-toe with the most powerful beings in this world, I needed to push myself to my utmost limit...and then I needed to push even further. After nearly dying as a victim of his own strength, Arthur Leywin wakes to find himself far from the continent where he was born for the second time. Alone, broken, and with no way to tell his family he’s alive, Arthur must rebuild his strength to survive. As he ascends through an ancient dungeon filled with hostile beasts and devious trials, he discovers an ancient, absolute power - a power that will either ruin him or take him to new heights. But the dungeon won’t give up its knowledge easily. Before he can plunder its depths, Arthur must learn to untangle the threads of fate. He must band together with the unlikeliest of allies if he hopes to escape with his life.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0a7495/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":"/metadata/books/kw0a7495/cover.jpg","genres":["Science Fiction &

His god has spoken to him, admittedly while currently in the shape of a tortoise.   Brutha is a simple lad. He can't read. He can't write. He's pretty good at growing melons. And his wants are few. He wants to overthrow a huge and corrupt church. He wants to prevent a horribly holy war. He wants to stop the persecution of a philosopher who has dared to suggest that, contrary to the Church's dogma, the Discworld really does go through space on the back of an enormous turtle. (Which is true, but when has that ever mattered?) He wants peace and justice and brotherly love. He wants the Inquisition to stop torturing him now, please. But most of all, what he really wants more than anything else, is for his god to choose someone else.... Please note: This is a vintage recording.

Why am I not dead? I should be dead. Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss’ family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.  It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans - except Katniss.  The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss’ willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels’ Mockingjay - no matter what the personal cost.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0db5di/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Teen & Young Adult","Literature & Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1636962676699,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Suzanne Collins/Mockingjay","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Suzanne Collins/Mockingjay","addedAt":1636962671776,"lastUpdate":1636962676699,"duration":40771936,"size":317931447,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":2,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":14.226,"title":"Chapter 0 (Track 1)"},{"id":1,"start":14.226,"end":1570.076,"title":"Chapter 1 (Track 2)"},{"id":2,"start":1570.076,"end":2422.021,"title":"Chapter 2 (Track 3)"},{"id":3,"start":2422.021,"end":3397.574,"title":"Chapter 3 (Track 4)"},{"id":4,"start":3397.574,"end":5041.254,"title":"Chapter 4 (Track 5)"},{"id":5,"start":5041.254,"end":6225.134,"title":"Chapter 5 (Track 6)"},{"id":6,"start":6225.134,"end":7603.464,"title":"Chapter 6 (Track 7)"},{"id":7,"start":7603.464,"end":8865.564,"title":"Chapter 7 (Track 8)"},{"id":8,"start":8865.564,"end":10525.444,"title":"Chapter 8 (Track 9)"},{"id":9,"start":10525.444,"end":12043.144,"title":"Chapter 9 (Track 10)"},{"id":10,"start":12043.144,"end":13079.214,"title":"Chapter 10 (Track 11)"},{"id":11,"start":13079.214,"end":14134.084,"title":"Chapter 11 (Track 12)"},{"id":12,"start":14134.084,"end":15666.334,"title":"Chapter 12 (Track 13)"},{"id":13,"start":15666.334,"end":17119.474,"title":"Chapter 13 (Track 14)"},{"id":14,"start":17119.474,"end":18312.954,"title":"Chapter 14 (Track 15)"},{"id":15,"start":18312.954,"end":19743.924,"title":"Chapter 15 (Track 16)"},{"id":16,"start":19743.924,"end":21010.272,"title":"Chapter 16 (Track 17)"},{"id":17,"start":21010.272,"end":22451.802,"title":"Chapter 17 (Track 18)"},{"id":18,"start":22451.802,"end":24135.721999999998,"title":"Chapter 18 (Track 19)"},{"id":19,"start":24135.721999999998,"end":25486.902,"title":"Chapter 19 (Track 20)"},{"id":20,"start":25486.902,"end":27234.551999999996,"title":"Chapter 20 (Track 21)"},{"id":21,"start":27234.551999999996,"end":28511.651999999995,"title":"Chapter 21 (Track 22)"},{"id":22,"start":28511.651999999995,"end":29859.601999999995,"title":"Chapter 22 (Track 23)"},{"id":23,"start":29859.601999999995,"end":31297.271999999997,"title":"Chapter 23 (Track 24)"},{"id":24,"start":31297.271999999997,"end":32431.931999999997,"title":"Chapter 24 (Track 25)"},{"id":25,"start":32431.931999999997,"end":34039.272,"title":"Chapter 25 (Track 26)"},{"id":26,"start":34039.272,"end":35039.992,"title":"Chapter 26 (Track 27)"},{"id":27,"start":35039.992,"end":35939.043,"title":"Chapter 27 (Track 28)"},{"id":28,"start":35939.043,"end":37149.163,"title":"Chapter 28 (Track 29)"},{"id":29,"start":37149.163,"end":38616.593,"title":"Chapter 29 (Track 30)"},{"id":30,"start":38616.593,"end":39587.869000000006,"title":"Chapter 30 (Track 31)"},{"id":31,"start":39587.869000000006,"end":40469.444,"title":"Chapter 31 (Track 32)"},{"id":32,"start":40469.444,"end":40667.844000000005,"title":"Chapter 32 (Track 33)"},{"id":33,"start":40667.844000000005,"end":40771.936,"title":"Chapter 33 (Track 34)"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0dbfnq","ino":"18267170549787944459","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell","subtitle":null,"author":"Susanna Clarke","authorFL":"Susanna Clarke","authorLF":"Clarke, Susanna","narrator":"Simon Prebble","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2004","publisher":null,"description":"English magicians were once the wonder of the known world, with fairy servants at their beck and call; they could command winds, mountains, and woods. But by the early 1800s they have long since lost the ability to perform magic. They can only write long, dull papers about it, while fairy servants are nothing but a fading memory. But at Hurtfew Abbey in Yorkshire, the rich, reclusive Mr. Norrell has assembled a wonderful library of lost and forgotten books from England's magical past and regained some of the powers of England's magicians. He goes to London and raises a beautiful young woman from the dead. Soon he is lending his help to the government in the war against Napoleon Bonaparte, creating ghostly fleets of rain-ships to confuse and alarm the French. All goes well until a rival magician appears. Jonathan Strange is handsome, charming, and talkative, the very opposite of Mr. Norrell. Strange thinks nothing of enduring the rigors of campaigning with Wellington's army and doing magic on battlefields. Astonished to find another practicing magician, Mr. Norrell accepts Strange as a pupil. But it soon becomes clear that their ideas of what English magic ought to be are very different. For Mr. Norrell, their power is something to be cautiously controlled, while Jonathan Strange will always be attracted to the wildest, most perilous forms of magic. He becomes fascinated by the ancient, shadowy figure of the Raven King, a child taken by fairies who became king of both England and Faerie, and the most legendary magician of all. Eventually Strange's heedless pursuit of long-forgotten magic threatens to destroy not only his partnership with Norrell, but everything that he holds dear. Sophisticated, witty, and ingeniously convincing, Susanna Clarke's magisterial novel weaves magic into a flawlessly detailed vision of historical England. She has created a world so thoroughly enchanting that 32 hours leave readers longing for more.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0dbfnq/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1636963085941,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Susanna Clarke/Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Susanna Clarke/Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell","addedAt":1636962684946,"lastUpdate":1636963085941,"duration":117126414,"size":1434220173,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":138,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":848.902,"title":"Susanna Clarke -

Treachery and brutality rule the land, and Albion is the scene of an epic struggle for the throne. Lewis Gillies returns as Llew, seeking the true meaning behind a mysterious prophecy - the making of a true king and the revealing of a long awaited champion: Silver Hand. The ancient Celts admitted no spearation between this world and the Otherworld: the two were delicately interwoven, each dependent on the other. The Silver Hand crosses the thin places between this world and that, as Lewis Gillies seeks to learn the secret of the prophecy of The Silver Hand - and to save Albion before it is too late.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw0dw6zx/cover2.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Stephen R.

But Bane’s acolyte, Zannah, has yet to engage her Master in mortal combat and prove herself a worthy successor. Determined that the Sith dream of galactic domination will not die with him, Bane vows to learn the secret of a forgotten Dark Lord that will assure the Sith’s immortality - and his own. A perfect opportunity arises when a Jedi emissary is assassinated on the troubled mining planet Doan, giving Bane an excuse to dispatch his apprentice on a fact-finding mission - while he himself sets out in secret to capture the ancient holocron of Darth Andeddu and its precious knowledge. But Zannah is no fool. She knows that her ruthless Master has begun to doubt her, and she senses that he is hiding something crucial to her future. If she is going to claim the power she craves, she must take action now. While Bane storms the remote stronghold of a fanatical Sith cult, Zannah prepares for her Master’s downfall by choosing an apprentice of her own: a rogue Jedi cunning and cold-blooded enough to embrace the Sith way and to stand beside her when she at last wrests from Bane the mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith. But Zannah is not the only one with the desire and power to destroy Darth Bane. Princess Serra of the Doan royal family is haunted by memories of the monstrous Sith soldier who murdered her father and tortured her when she was a child. Bent on retribution, she hires a merciless assassin to find her tormentor - and bring him back alive to taste her wrath. Only a Sith who has taken down her own Master can become Dark Lord of the Sith. So when Bane suddenly vanishes, Zannah must find him - possibly even rescue him - before she can kill him. And so she pursues her quarry from the grim depths of a ravaged world on the brink of catastrophe to the barren reaches of a desert outpost, where the future of the dark side’s most powerful disciples will be decided, once and for all, by the final, fatal stroke of a lightsaber.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0eb99m/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Science Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1636996914842,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Star Wars/03 - Dynasty of Evil","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Star Wars/03 - Dynasty of Evil","addedAt":1636964356502,"lastUpdate":1636996914842,"duration":33846336,"size":199149573,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":2,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":17265.708,"title":"Dynasty of Evil 01"},{"id":1,"start":17265.708,"end":33846.335999999996,"title":"Dynasty of Evil 02"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0ek0gt","ino":"8796622660653437813","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Tyrant's Throne","subtitle":null,"author":"Sebastien de Castell","authorFL":"Sebastien de Castell","authorLF":"de Castell, Sebastien","narrator":"Joe Jameson","series":"The Greatcoats","volumeNumber":"4","publishYear":"2017","publisher":null,"description":"Would you - could you? - uphold the law at the cost of those you love?

But for the Greatcoats, nothing is ever that simple. In neighbouring Avares, an enigmatic new warlord is uniting the barbarian armies, and, even worse, he is rumoured to have a new ally: Falcio's old nemesis Trin.

Everything has a spirit: the willow tree with leaves that kiss the pond, the stream that feeds the river, the wind that exhales fresh snow. And those spirits want to kill you. It's the first lesson that every Renthian learns. Not long ago, Daleina used her strength and skill to survive those spirits and assume the royal throne. Since then, the new queen has kept the peace and protected the humans of her land. But now for all her power, she is hiding a terrible secret: She is dying. And if she leaves the world before a new heir is ready, the spirits that inhabit her beloved realm will run wild, destroying her cities and slaughtering her people. Naelin is one such person, and she couldn't be further removed from the queen - and she wouldn't have it any other way. Her world is her two children, her husband, and the remote village tucked deep in the forest that is her home, and that's all she needs. But when Ven, the queen's champion, passes through the village, Naelin's ambitious husband proudly tells him of his wife's ability to control spirits - magic that Naelin fervently denies. She knows that if the truth of her abilities is known, it will bring only death and separation from those she loves. But Ven has a single task: to find the best possible candidate to protect the people of Aratay. He did it once when he discovered Daleina, and he's certain he's done it again. Yet for all his appeals to duty, Naelin is a mother, and she knows her duty is to her children first and foremost. Only as the queen's power begins to wane and the spirits become emboldened - even as ominous rumors trickle down from the north - does she realize that the best way to keep her son and daughter safe is to risk everything. Sarah Beth Durst established a place of dark wonder in The Queen of Blood, and now the stakes are even higher as the threat to the queen and her people grows both from within and beyond the borders of Aratay in this riveting second novel of the Queens of Renthia series.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0flxo2/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1636966644934,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Sarah Beth Durst/The Reluctant Queen","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Sarah Beth Durst/The Reluctant Queen","addedAt":1636966533925,"lastUpdate":1636966644934,"duration":49629837,"size":382846967,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":41,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":14.164188,"title":"Chapter 01"},{"id":1,"start":14.164188,"end":1633.7295629999999,"title":"Chapter 02"},{"id":2,"start":1633.7295629999999,"end":2970.883563,"title":"Chapter 03"},{"id":3,"start":2970.883563,"end":4403.096813,"title":"Chapter 04"},{"id":4,"start":4403.096813,"end":5734.122063,"title":"Chapter 05"},{"id":5,"start":5734.122063,"end":6792.975063,"title":"Chapter 06"},{"id":6,"start":6792.975063,"end":8511.188688,"title":"Chapter 07"},{"id":7,"start":8511.188688,"end":10107.130688000001,"title":"Chapter 08"},{"id":8,"start":10107.130688000001,"end":11614.786188000002,"title":"Chapter 09"},{"id":9,"start":11614.786188000002,"end":12556.752688000002,"title":"Chapter 10"},{"id":10,"start":12556.752688000002,"end":13803.227688000003,"title":"Chapter 11"},{"id":11,"start":13803.227688000003,"end":15054.873563000003,"title":"Chapter 12"},{"id":12,"start":15054.873563000003,"end":16095.690126000003,"title":"Chapter 13"},{"id":13,"start":16095.690126000003,"end":18219.887126,"title":"Chapter 14"},{"id":14,"start":18219.887126,"end":19968.498751000003,"title":"Chapter 15"},{"id":15,"start":19968.498751000003,"end":21578.535501000002,"title":"Chapter 16"},{"id":16,"start":21578.535501000002,"end":22811.117001000002,"title":"Chapter 17"},{"id":17,"start":22811.117001000002,"end":24226.274626000002,"title":"Chapter 18"},{"id":18,"start":24226.274626000002,"end":26061.627626,"title":"Chapter 19"},{"id":19,"start":26061.627626,"end":27505.025001,"title":"Chapter 20"},{"id":20,"start":27505.025001,"end":29146.379751,"title":"Chapter 21"},{"id":21,"start":29146.379751,"end":30750.843626,"title":"Chapter 22"},{"id":22,"start":30750.843626,"end":32002.334751000002,"title":"Chapter 23"},{"id":23,"start":32002.334751000002,"end":33356.176626,"title":"Chapter 24"},{"id":24,"start":33356.176626,"end":34740.696376,"title":"Chapter 25"},{"id":25,"start":34740.696376,"end":36371.440251,"title":"Chapter 26"},{"id":26,"start":36371.440251,"end":37932.466501,"title":"Chapter 27"},{"id":27,"start":37932.466501,"end":39097.542751,"title":"Chapter 28"},{"id":28,"start":39097.542751,"end":39843.845251,"title":"Chapter 29"},{"id":29,"start":39843.845251,"end":40704.299189,"title":"Chapter 30"},{"id":30,"start":40704.299189,"end":41676.275001999995,"title":"Chapter 31"},{"id":31,"start":41676.275001999995,"end":42806.509251999996,"title":"Chapter 32"},{"id":32,"start":42806.509251999996,"end":43680.827815,"title":"Chapter 33"},{"id":33,"start":43680.827815,"end":44496.500315,"title":"Chapter 34"},{"id":34,"start":44496.500315,"end":45355.703627999996,"title":"Chapter 35"},{"id":35,"start":45355.703627999996,"end":46856.709628,"title":"Chapter 36"},{"id":36,"start":46856.709628,"end":47553.939191,"title":"Chapter 37"},{"id":37,"start":47553.939191,"end":48674.356066,"title":"Chapter 38"},{"id":38,"start":48674.356066,"end":49121.789316,"title":"Chapter 39"},{"id":39,"start":49121.789316,"end":49597.192097,"title":"Chapter 40"},{"id":40,"start":49597.192097,"end":49629.836941,"title":"Chapter 41"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0fyckw","ino":"10607711474564938486","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Normal People","subtitle":null,"author":"Sally Rooney","authorFL":"Sally Rooney","authorLF":"Rooney, Sally","narrator":"Aoife McMahon","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2019","publisher":null,"description":"Now an Emmy-nominated a Hulu original series • New York Times best seller \"A stunning novel about the transformative power of relationships\" (People) from the author of Conversations with Friends, \"a master of the literary page-turner\" (J.

At school, Connell is popular and well liked, while Marianne is a loner. But when the two strike up a conversation - awkward but electrifying - something life changing begins. A year later, they’re both studying at Trinity College in Dublin. Marianne has found her feet in a new social world while Connell hangs at the sidelines, shy and uncertain. Throughout their years at university, Marianne and Connell circle one another, straying toward other people and possibilities but always magnetically, irresistibly drawn back together. And as she veers into self-destruction and he begins to search for meaning elsewhere, each must confront how far they are willing to go to save the other.

King Shrewd is dead at the hands of his son Regal. As is Fitz - or so his enemies and friends believe. But with the help of his allies and his beast magic, he emerges from the grave, deeply scarred in body and soul. The kingdom also teeters toward ruin: Regal has plundered and abandoned the capital, while the rightful heir, Prince Verity, is lost to his mad quest - perhaps to death. Only Verity's return - or the heir his princess carries - can save the Six Duchies. But Fitz will not wait. Driven by loss and bitter memories, he undertakes a quest: to kill Regal. The journey casts him into deep waters, as he discovers wild currents of magic within him - currents that will either drown him or make him something more than he was.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0jj1r1/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637003638800,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Robin Hobb/Farseer 03 - Assassin's Quest","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Robin Hobb/Farseer 03 - Assassin's Quest","addedAt":1636973117350,"lastUpdate":1637003638800,"duration":135303443,"size":1079687780,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":42,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":516.0,"title":"Chapter 0 (Opening Credits)"},{"id":1,"start":516.0,"end":4938.0,"title":"Chapter 1 (Chapter 1)"},{"id":2,"start":4938.0,"end":8647.0,"title":"Chapter 2 (Chapter 2)"},{"id":3,"start":8647.0,"end":12085.0,"title":"Chapter 3 (Chapter 3)"},{"id":4,"start":12085.0,"end":15779.0,"title":"Chapter 4 (Chapter 4)"},{"id":5,"start":15779.0,"end":20554.0,"title":"Chapter 5 (Chapter 5)"},{"id":6,"start":20554.0,"end":23772.0,"title":"Chapter 6 (Chapter 6)"},{"id":7,"start":23772.0,"end":27280.0,"title":"Chapter 7 (Chapter 7)"},{"id":8,"start":27280.0,"end":30679.0,"title":"Chapter 8 (Chapter 8)"},{"id":9,"start":30679.0,"end":35204.0,"title":"Chapter 9 (Chapter 9)"},{"id":10,"start":35204.0,"end":37895.0,"title":"Chapter 10 (Chapter 10)"},{"id":11,"start":37895.0,"end":41500.0,"title":"Chapter 11 (Chapter 11)"},{"id":12,"start":41500.0,"end":45772.0,"title":"Chapter 12 (Chapter 12)"},{"id":13,"start":45772.0,"end":49605.0,"title":"Chapter 13 (Chapter 13)"},{"id":14,"start":49605.0,"end":52379.0,"title":"Chapter 14 (Chapter 14)"},{"id":15,"start":52379.0,"end":55140.0,"title":"Chapter 15 (Chapter 15)"},{"id":16,"start":55140.0,"end":58342.0,"title":"Chapter 16 (Chapter 16)"},{"id":17,"start":58342.0,"end":61278.0,"title":"Chapter 17 (Chapter 17)"},{"id":18,"start":61278.0,"end":63975.0,"title":"Chapter 18 (Chapter 18)"},{"id":19,"start":63975.0,"end":67082.990998,"title":"Chapter 19 (Chapter 19)"},{"id":20,"start":67082.990998,"end":69949.990998,"title":"Chapter 20 (Chapter 20)"},{"id":21,"start":69949.990998,"end":74057.990998,"title":"Chapter 21 (Chapter 21)"},{"id":22,"start":74057.990998,"end":77930.990998,"title":"Chapter 22 (Chapter 22)"},{"id":23,"start":77930.990998,"end":81188.990998,"title":"Chapter 23 (Chapter 23)"},{"id":24,"start":81188.990998,"end":84641.990998,"title":"Chapter 24 (Chapter 24)"},{"id":25,"start":84641.990998,"end":87596.990998,"title":"Chapter 25 (Chapter 25)"},{"id":26,"start":87596.990998,"end":90594.990998,"title":"Chapter 26 (Chapter 26)"},{"id":27,"start":90594.990998,"end":94196.990998,"title":"Chapter 27 (Chapter 27)"},{"id":28,"start":94196.990998,"end":97963.990998,"title":"Chapter 28 (Chapter 28)"},{"id":29,"start":97963.990998,"end":101406.990998,"title":"Chapter 29 (Chapter 29)"},{"id":30,"start":101406.990998,"end":104804.990998,"title":"Chapter 30 (Chapter 30)"},{"id":31,"start":104804.990998,"end":107628.990998,"title":"Chapter 31 (Chapter 31)"},{"id":32,"start":107628.990998,"end":110205.990998,"title":"Chapter 32 (Chapter 32)"},{"id":33,"start":110205.990998,"end":113245.990998,"title":"Chapter 33 (Chapter 33)"},{"id":34,"start":113245.990998,"end":115919.990998,"title":"Chapter 34 (Chapter 34)"},{"id":35,"start":115919.990998,"end":119129.990998,"title":"Chapter 35 (Chapter 35)"},{"id":36,"start":119129.990998,"end":123301.967007,"title":"Chapter 36 (Chapter 36)"},{"id":37,"start":123301.967007,"end":125649.967007,"title":"Chapter 37 (Chapter 37)"},{"id":38,"start":125649.967007,"end":128785.967007,"title":"Chapter 38 (Chapter 38)"},{"id":39,"start":128785.967007,"end":132344.967007,"title":"Chapter 39 (Chapter 39)"},{"id":40,"start":132344.967007,"end":134285.967007,"title":"Chapter 40 (Chapter 40)"},{"id":41,"start":134285.967007,"end":135279.967007,"title":"Chapter 41 (Chapter 41)"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0jze8l","ino":"8909622146757029032","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Assassin's Apprentice","subtitle":null,"author":"Robin Hobb","authorFL":"Robin Hobb","authorLF":"Hobb, Robin","narrator":"Paul Boehmer","series":"Farseer Trilogy","volumeNumber":"1","publishYear":"1995","publisher":null,"description":"The first volume in Robin Hobb’s internationally best-selling Farseer series.

The Pattern itself is unraveling, and the armies of the Shadow have begun to boil out of the Blight.The sun has begun to set upon the Third Age.  Perrin Aybara is now hunted by specters from his past: Whitecloaks, a slayer of wolves, and the responsibilities of leadership. All the while, an unseen foe is slowly pulling a noose tight around his neck. To prevail, he must seek answers in Tel'aran'rhiod and find a way - at long last - to master the wolf within him or lose himself to it forever.  Meanwhile, Matrim Cauthon prepares for the most difficult challenge of his life. The creatures beyond the stone gateways - the Aelfinn and the Eelfinn - have confused him, taunted him, and left him hanged, his memory stuffed with bits and pieces of other men's lives. He had hoped that his last confrontation with them would be the end of it, but the Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills. The time is coming when he will again have to dance with the Snakes and the Foxes, playing a game that cannot be won.

A Memory of Light is the fantastic conclusion to the internationally best-selling epic fantasy juggernaut. The Wheel of Time turns and ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend.

With all of her signature wit and heart, this is Rainbow at her absolute best. The story is supposed to be over. Simon Snow did everything he was supposed to do. He beat the villain. He won the war. He even fell in love. Now comes the good part, right? Now comes the happily ever after....  So why can’t Simon Snow get off the couch? What he needs, according to his best friend, is a change of scenery. He just needs to see himself in a new light. That’s how Simon and Penny and Baz end up in a vintage convertible, tearing across the American West. They find trouble, of course. (Dragons, vampires, skunk-headed things with shotguns.) And they get lost. They get so lost, they start to wonder whether they ever knew where they were headed in the first place. With Wayward Son, Rainbow Rowell has written a book for everyone who ever wondered what happened to the Chosen One after he saved the day. And a book for everyone who was ever more curious about the second kiss than the first.  Come on, Simon Snow. Your hero’s journey might be over - but your life has just begun.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0ob5w6/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Teen","Literature &

Like his fellow Reds, he works all day, believing that he and his people are making the surface of Mars livable for future generations. Yet he spends his life willingly, knowing that his blood and sweat will one day result in a better world for his children. But Darrow and his kind have been betrayed. Soon he discovers that humanity reached the surface generations ago. Vast cities and sprawling parks spread across the planet. Darrow - and Reds like him - are nothing more than slaves to a decadent ruling class. Inspired by a longing for justice, and driven by the memory of lost love, Darrow sacrifices everything to infiltrate the legendary Institute, a proving ground for the dominant Gold caste, where the next generation of humanity's overlords struggle for power. He will be forced to compete for his life and the very future of civilization against the best and most brutal of Society's ruling class. There, he will stop at nothing to bring down his enemies...even if it means he has to become one of them to do so.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0qtphw/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637002279523,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Pierce Brown/Red Rising","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Pierce Brown/Red Rising","addedAt":1636985372256,"lastUpdate":1637002279523,"duration":58348855,"size":713665404,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":45,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":1181.106,"title":"Red Rising - 01"},{"id":1,"start":1181.106,"end":2672.525,"title":"Red Rising - 02"},{"id":2,"start":2672.525,"end":3890.1800000000003,"title":"Red Rising - 03"},{"id":3,"start":3890.1800000000003,"end":5127.061000000001,"title":"Red Rising - 04"},{"id":4,"start":5127.061000000001,"end":6447.395,"title":"Red Rising - 05"},{"id":5,"start":6447.395,"end":7589.075000000001,"title":"Red Rising - 06"},{"id":6,"start":7589.075000000001,"end":8239.698,"title":"Red Rising - 07"},{"id":7,"start":8239.698,"end":9691.92,"title":"Red Rising - 08"},{"id":8,"start":9691.92,"end":10354.293,"title":"Red Rising - 09"},{"id":9,"start":10354.293,"end":11783.342,"title":"Red Rising - 10"},{"id":10,"start":11783.342,"end":12249.227,"title":"Red Rising - 11"},{"id":11,"start":12249.227,"end":14304.332,"title":"Red Rising - 12"},{"id":12,"start":14304.332,"end":15338.689,"title":"Red Rising - 13"},{"id":13,"start":15338.689,"end":15964.049,"title":"Red Rising - 14"},{"id":14,"start":15964.049,"end":16877.429,"title":"Red Rising - 15"},{"id":15,"start":16877.429,"end":18678.136,"title":"Red Rising - 16"},{"id":16,"start":18678.136,"end":19337.909,"title":"Red Rising - 17"},{"id":17,"start":19337.909,"end":20113.503,"title":"Red Rising - 18"},{"id":18,"start":20113.503,"end":20895.365,"title":"Red Rising - 19"},{"id":19,"start":20895.365,"end":22704.34,"title":"Red Rising - 20"},{"id":20,"start":22704.34,"end":24374.413,"title":"Red Rising - 21"},{"id":21,"start":24374.413,"end":26016.017,"title":"Red Rising - 22"},{"id":22,"start":26016.017,"end":27317.124,"title":"Red Rising - 23"},{"id":23,"start":27317.124,"end":28274.947,"title":"Red Rising - 24"},{"id":24,"start":28274.947,"end":29013.064,"title":"Red Rising - 25"},{"id":25,"start":29013.064,"end":30782.703999999998,"title":"Red Rising - 26"},{"id":26,"start":30782.703999999998,"end":31885.002999999997,"title":"Red Rising - 27"},{"id":27,"start":31885.002999999997,"end":32599.761,"title":"Red Rising - 28"},{"id":28,"start":32599.761,"end":33811.888999999996,"title":"Red Rising - 29"},{"id":29,"start":33811.888999999996,"end":35650.956,"title":"Red Rising - 30"},{"id":30,"start":35650.956,"end":36789.292,"title":"Red Rising - 31"},{"id":31,"start":36789.292,"end":38641.084,"title":"Red Rising - 32"},{"id":32,"start":38641.084,"end":39350.314000000006,"title":"Red Rising - 33"},{"id":33,"start":39350.314000000006,"end":42191.834,"title":"Red Rising - 34"},{"id":34,"start":42191.834,"end":43545.048,"title":"Red Rising - 35"},{"id":35,"start":43545.048,"end":45742.817,"title":"Red Rising - 36"},{"id":36,"start":45742.817,"end":47440.197,"title":"Red Rising - 37"},{"id":37,"start":47440.197,"end":49730.336,"title":"Red Rising - 38"},{"id":38,"start":49730.336,"end":50533.376000000004,"title":"Red Rising - 39"},{"id":39,"start":50533.376000000004,"end":51967.162000000004,"title":"Red Rising - 40"},{"id":40,"start":51967.162000000004,"end":53643.876000000004,"title":"Red Rising - 41"},{"id":41,"start":53643.876000000004,"end":54864.41100000001,"title":"Red Rising - 42"},{"id":42,"start":54864.41100000001,"end":56629.45300000001,"title":"Red Rising - 43"},{"id":43,"start":56629.45300000001,"end":58116.04100000001,"title":"Red Rising - 44"},{"id":44,"start":58116.04100000001,"end":58348.85500000001,"title":"Red Rising - 45"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0rxuil","ino":"10745233993431613423","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Dark Age","subtitle":null,"author":"Pierce Brown","authorFL":"Pierce Brown","authorLF":"Brown, Pierce","narrator":"Tim Gerard Reynolds; John Curless; Moira Quirk; James Langton; Rendah Heywood","series":"Red Rising","volumeNumber":"5","publishYear":"2019","publisher":null,"description":"For a decade, Darrow led a revolution against the corrupt color-coded Society. Now, outlawed by the very Republic he founded, he wages a rogue war on Mercury in hopes that he can still salvage the dream of Eo. But as he leaves death and destruction in his wake, is he still the hero who broke the chains? Or will another legend rise to take his place? Lysander au Lune, the heir in exile, has returned to the Core. Determined to bring peace back to mankind at the edge of his sword, he must overcome or unite the treacherous Gold families of the Core and face down Darrow over the skies of war-torn Mercury.  But theirs are not the only fates hanging in the balance. On Luna, Mustang, Sovereign of the Republic, campaigns to unite the Republic behind her husband. Beset by political and criminal enemies, can she outwit her opponents in time to save him?  Once a Red refugee, young Lyria now stands accused of treason, and her only hope is a desperate escape with unlikely new allies.  Abducted by a new threat to the Republic, Pax and Electra, the children of Darrow and Sevro, must trust in Ephraim, a thief, for their salvation - and Ephraim must look to them for his chance at redemption. As alliances shift, break, and re-form - and power is seized, lost, and reclaimed - every player is at risk in a game of conquest that could turn the Rising into a new Dark Age.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0rxuil/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Science

A BBC Radio 4 adaptation of Anansi Boys, featuring an all-star cast lead by Lenny Henry, premiered on Christmas Day 2017. Fat Charlie Nancy is not actually fat. He was fat once but he is definitely not fat now. No, right now Fat Charlie Nancy is angry, confused and more than a little scared - right now his life is spinning out of control, and it is all his dad's fault. If his rotter of an estranged father hadn't dropped dead at a karaoke night, Charlie would still be blissfully unaware that his dad was Anansi the spider god. He would have no idea that he has a brother called Spider, who is also a god. And there would be no chance that said brother would be trying to take over his life, flat and fiancée, or, to make matters worse, be doing a much better job of it than him. Desperate to reclaim his life, Charlie enlists the help of four more-than-slightly eccentric old ladies and their unique brand of voodoo - and between them they unleash a bitter and twisted force to get rid of Spider. But as darkness descends and badness begins is Fat Charlie Nancy going to get his life back in one piece or is he about to enter a whole netherworld of pain?","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0u25vm/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1636991199254,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Neil Gaiman/Anansi Boys","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Neil Gaiman/Anansi Boys","addedAt":1636990805390,"lastUpdate":1636991199254,"duration":36369605,"size":446994683,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":57,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":561.346,"title":"AB-1_01 -

Everyone loves Orion Lake. Everyone else, that is. Far as I’m concerned, he can keep his flashy combat magic to himself. I’m not joining his pack of adoring fans. I don’t need help surviving the Scholomance, even if they do. Forget the hordes of monsters and cursed artifacts, I’m probably the most dangerous thing in the place. Just give me a chance and I’ll level mountains and kill untold millions, make myself the dark queen of the world. At least, that’s what the world expects.  Most of the other students in here would be delighted if Orion killed me like one more evil thing that’s crawled out of the drains. Sometimes I think they want me to turn into the evil witch they assume I am. The school certainly does. But the Scholomance isn’t getting what it wants from me. And neither is Orion Lake. I may not be anyone’s idea of the shining hero, but I’m going to make it out of this place alive, and I’m not going to slaughter thousands to do it, either. Although I’m giving serious consideration to just one. With flawless mastery, Naomi Novik creates a school bursting with magic like you’ve never seen before and a heroine for the ages - a character so sharply realized and so richly nuanced that she will live on in hearts and minds for generations to come. Praise for Deadly Education “The can’t-miss fantasy of fall 2020, a brutal coming-of-power story steeped in the aesthetics of dark academia.... A Deadly Education will cement Naomi Novik’s place as one of the greatest and most versatile fantasy writers of our time.” (BookPage, starred review)  “A must-read.... Novik puts a refreshingly dark, adult spin on the magical boarding school.... Readers will delight in the push-and-pull of El and Orion’s relationship, the fantastically detailed world, the clever magic system, and the matter-of-fact diversity of the student body.” (Publishers Weekly, starred review)","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw0ulnnd/A Deadly Education-Cover.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Naomi Novik/A Deadly Education/A Deadly Education-Cover.jpg","genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637006976992,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Naomi Novik/A Deadly Education","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Naomi Novik/A Deadly Education","addedAt":1636991714710,"lastUpdate":1637006976992,"duration":39546182,"size":641415053,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":11,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":4509.545,"title":"A Deadly Education-Part01"},{"id":1,"start":4509.545,"end":7490.195,"title":"A Deadly Education-Part02"},{"id":2,"start":7490.195,"end":11868.866999999998,"title":"A Deadly Education-Part03"},{"id":3,"start":11868.866999999998,"end":16420.992,"title":"A Deadly Education-Part04"},{"id":4,"start":16420.992,"end":18819.346999999998,"title":"A Deadly Education-Part05"},{"id":5,"start":18819.346999999998,"end":22410.060999999998,"title":"A Deadly Education-Part06"},{"id":6,"start":22410.060999999998,"end":26516.85,"title":"A Deadly Education-Part07"},{"id":7,"start":26516.85,"end":31191.070999999996,"title":"A Deadly Education-Part08"},{"id":8,"start":31191.070999999996,"end":34013.96799999999,"title":"A Deadly Education-Part09"},{"id":9,"start":34013.96799999999,"end":36699.225999999995,"title":"A Deadly Education-Part10"},{"id":10,"start":36699.225999999995,"end":39546.18199999999,"title":"A Deadly Education-Part11"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0uqhby","ino":"13575168487824606707","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Aching God","subtitle":null,"author":"Mike Shel","authorFL":"Mike Shel","authorLF":"Shel, Mike","narrator":"Simon Vance","series":"Iconoclasts Series","volumeNumber":"1","publishYear":"2018","publisher":null,"description":"Winner of 2019 Voice Arts Award, Audiobook Narration - Fantasy \"Closer, mortal.

His father, leading the wise and benevolent Council of Mages, protected and guided the citizens of the Golden City of the Bells. Young Mages in training---all men, for women were unfit to practice magic---memorized the intricate details of High Magic and aspired to seats on the council. Then Kellen found the forbidden Books of Wild Magic---or did they find him? Their Magic felt like a living thing, guided by the hearts and minds of those who practiced it and benefited from it. Questioning everything he has known, Kellen discovers too many of the City's dark secrets. Banished, with the Outlaw Hunt on his heels, Kellen invokes Wild Magic---and finds himself running for his life with a unicorn at his side. Rescued by a unicorn, healed by a female Wild Mage who knows more about Kellen than anyone outside the City should, meeting Elven royalty and Elven warriors, and plunged into a world full of magical beings, Kellen both revels in and fears his new freedom. The one thing all the Mages of the City agreed on was that practicing Wild Magic corrupted a Mage---turned him into a Demon. Would that be Kellen's fate? Deep in Obsidian Mountain, the Demons are waiting. Since their defeat in the last great War, they've been biding their time, sowing the seeds of distrust and discontent between their human and Elven enemies. Very soon now, when the Demons rise to make war, there will be no alliance between High and Wild Magic to stand against them. And then all the world will belong to the Endarkened.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0x8hua/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction &

of the complex and fascinating world they originally created for the Obsidian Trilogy. Jumping ahead one thousand years in time, Lackey and Mallory have told the compelling story of Harrier Gillain, the first Knight-Mage in a thousand years; Tiercel Rolfort, the first High Mage in hundreds of years; and Shaiara, the young leader of a desert tribe who takes both boys under her wing but has a special affection for Harrier. These three young people are their world's main defense against the evil called up by the rogue Wild Mage Bisochim. Bisochim's conviction that he was restoring the balance was shattered the moment Ahairan took her first breath. Now, in The Phoenix Transformed, Bisochim joins forces with Harrier and Tiercel, and the three mages search desperately for a way to destroy Ahairan as she sends her magical forces against them and the desert nomads under their protection.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw0y27rj/endurflame3.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Mercedes Lackey and James Mallory/Enduring Flame 03 - The Phoenix Transformed/endurflame3.jpg","genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1636999917584,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Mercedes Lackey and James Mallory/Enduring Flame 03 - The Phoenix Transformed","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Mercedes Lackey and James Mallory/Enduring Flame 03 - The Phoenix Transformed","addedAt":1636997526098,"lastUpdate":1636999917584,"duration":89167492,"size":1445505189,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":3,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":28033.411,"title":"bk 03 The Phoenix Transformed pt 1"},{"id":1,"start":28033.411,"end":58081.934,"title":"bk 03 The Phoenix Transformed pt 2"},{"id":2,"start":58081.934,"end":89167.492,"title":"bk 03 The Phoenix Transformed pt 3"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0yncu6","ino":"1703658523899397778","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"The Knifes Edge","subtitle":null,"author":"Matthew Wolf","authorFL":"Matthew Wolf","authorLF":"Wolf, Matthew","narrator":"Tim Gerard Reynolds","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2014","publisher":null,"description":"When legends come to life, the world trembles from a single name.

But Circe is a strange child - not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring, like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power - the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.  Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur; Daedalus and his doomed son, Icarus; the murderous Medea; and, of course, wily Odysseus.  But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from or the mortals she has come to love.  With unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language and pause-resisting suspense, Circe is a triumph of storytelling, an intoxicating epic of family rivalry, palace intrigue, and love and loss as well as a celebration of indomitable female strength in a man's world.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1239uy/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637004579984,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Madeline Miller/Circe","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Madeline Miller/Circe","addedAt":1637004294813,"lastUpdate":1637004579984,"duration":43705801,"size":516174727,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":27,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":1217.308,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 01 of 27]"},{"id":1,"start":1217.308,"end":2432.317,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 02 of 27]"},{"id":2,"start":2432.317,"end":3605.87,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 03 of 27]"},{"id":3,"start":3605.87,"end":4811.266,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 04 of 27]"},{"id":4,"start":4811.266,"end":5943.518999999999,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 05 of 27]"},{"id":5,"start":5943.518999999999,"end":8324.241999999998,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 06 of 27]"},{"id":6,"start":8324.241999999998,"end":9853.478,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 07 of 27]"},{"id":7,"start":9853.478,"end":11056.392,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 08 of 27]"},{"id":8,"start":11056.392,"end":13079.289999999999,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 09 of 27]"},{"id":9,"start":13079.289999999999,"end":15241.759999999998,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 10 of 27]"},{"id":10,"start":15241.759999999998,"end":17127.305999999997,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 11 of 27]"},{"id":11,"start":17127.305999999997,"end":18094.360999999997,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 12 of 27]"},{"id":12,"start":18094.360999999997,"end":19925.415999999997,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 13 of 27]"},{"id":13,"start":19925.415999999997,"end":21449.217999999997,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 14 of 27]"},{"id":14,"start":21449.217999999997,"end":23110.162999999997,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 15 of 27]"},{"id":15,"start":23110.162999999997,"end":25480.593999999997,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 16 of 27]"},{"id":16,"start":25480.593999999997,"end":26656.915999999997,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 17 of 27]"},{"id":17,"start":26656.915999999997,"end":28350.722999999998,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 18 of 27]"},{"id":18,"start":28350.722999999998,"end":30811.355,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 19 of 27]"},{"id":19,"start":30811.355,"end":32105.071,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 20 of 27]"},{"id":20,"start":32105.071,"end":35645.135,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 21 of 27]"},{"id":21,"start":35645.135,"end":37266.897000000004,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 22 of 27]"},{"id":22,"start":37266.897000000004,"end":38826.435000000005,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 23 of 27]"},{"id":23,"start":38826.435000000005,"end":40493.885,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 24 of 27]"},{"id":24,"start":40493.885,"end":42386.432,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 25 of 27]"},{"id":25,"start":42386.432,"end":43168.461,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 26 of 27]"},{"id":26,"start":43168.461,"end":43705.801,"title":"Circe (Unabridged) [File 27 of 27]"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw12cyo1","ino":"12372311560859865133","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"The Hallowed Hunt","subtitle":null,"author":"Lois McMaster Bujold","authorFL":"Lois McMaster Bujold","authorLF":"Bujold, Lois McMaster","narrator":"Marguerite Gavin","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2005","publisher":null,"description":"Lois McMaster Bujold returns to the vivid, perilous world of her previous masterworks, the Hugo Award-winning Paladin of Souls and Hugo and World Fantasy Award-nominated The Curse of Chalion, with this tale of devotion and strange destiny.

A win-win-win, honestly.\" (Paste, best audiobooks of 2019) From number one New York Times best-selling author Leigh Bardugo comes a mesmerizing tale of power, privilege, and dark magic set among the Ivy League elite. This program includes a bonus conversation with the author. Galaxy \"Alex\" Stern is the most unlikely member of Yale’s freshman class. Raised in the Los Angeles hinterlands by a hippie mom, Alex dropped out of school early and into a world of shady drug-dealer boyfriends, dead-end jobs, and much, much worse. In fact, by age 20, she is the sole survivor of a horrific, unsolved multiple homicide. Some might say she’s thrown her life away. But at her hospital bed, Alex is offered a second chance: to attend one of the world’s most prestigious universities on a full ride. What’s the catch, and why her? Still searching for answers, Alex arrives in New Haven tasked by her mysterious benefactors with monitoring the activities of Yale’s secret societies. Their eight windowless \"tombs\" are the well-known haunts of the rich and powerful, from high-ranking politicos to Wall Street’s biggest players. But their occult activities are more sinister and more extraordinary than any paranoid imagination might conceive. They tamper with forbidden magic. They raise the dead. And, sometimes, they prey on the living. Ninth House is the long-awaited adult debut by the beloved author of Shadow and Bone and Six of Crows. Leigh Bardugo will take her place alongside Lev Grossman and Deborah Harkness as one of the finest practitioners of literary fantasy writing today.  A Macmillan Audio production from Flatiron Books  \"Ninth House is the best fantasy novel I’ve read in years, because it’s about real people. Bardugo’s imaginative reach is brilliant, and this story - full of shocks and twists - is impossible to put down.\" (Stephen King) \"Ninth House is one of the best fantasy novels I’ve read in years. This book is brilliant, funny, raw and utterly magnificent - it's a portal to a world you’ll never want to leave.\" (Lev Grossman, New York Times best-selling author of The Magicians) \"In this mesmerizing novel, Leigh Bardugo introduces us to Alex, a high-school dropout who gets a free ride to Yale because of a unique talent. Bardugo's New Haven is plausible and frightening, and I was one rapt reader.\" (Charlaine Harris, best-selling author of the True Blood series)","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw12ru5h/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637005480579,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Leigh Bardugo/Ninth House","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Leigh Bardugo/Ninth House","addedAt":1637005439926,"lastUpdate":1637005480579,"duration":58918176,"size":361322230,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":38,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":36.612,"title":"001 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":1,"start":36.612,"end":118.15200000000002,"title":"002 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":2,"start":118.15200000000002,"end":648.36,"title":"003 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":3,"start":648.36,"end":3335.436,"title":"004 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":4,"start":3335.436,"end":5178.852,"title":"005 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":5,"start":5178.852,"end":7123.139999999999,"title":"006 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":6,"start":7123.139999999999,"end":8928.395999999999,"title":"007 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":7,"start":8928.395999999999,"end":11810.771999999999,"title":"008 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":8,"start":11810.771999999999,"end":14325.624,"title":"009 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":9,"start":14325.624,"end":16861.86,"title":"010 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":10,"start":16861.86,"end":18627.768,"title":"011 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":11,"start":18627.768,"end":20472.156,"title":"012 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":12,"start":20472.156,"end":23065.631999999998,"title":"013 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":13,"start":23065.631999999998,"end":25146.359999999997,"title":"014 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":14,"start":25146.359999999997,"end":28223.747999999996,"title":"015 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":15,"start":28223.747999999996,"end":29721.383999999995,"title":"016 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":16,"start":29721.383999999995,"end":32281.775999999994,"title":"017 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":17,"start":32281.775999999994,"end":33416.13599999999,"title":"018 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":18,"start":33416.13599999999,"end":33979.35599999999,"title":"019 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":19,"start":33979.35599999999,"end":35051.471999999994,"title":"020 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":20,"start":35051.471999999994,"end":36228.70799999999,"title":"021 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":21,"start":36228.70799999999,"end":37944.28799999999,"title":"022 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":22,"start":37944.28799999999,"end":38485.439999999995,"title":"023 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":23,"start":38485.439999999995,"end":41331.564,"title":"024 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":24,"start":41331.564,"end":42945.335999999996,"title":"025 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":25,"start":42945.335999999996,"end":44174.087999999996,"title":"026 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":26,"start":44174.087999999996,"end":45752.291999999994,"title":"027 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":27,"start":45752.291999999994,"end":47519.06399999999,"title":"028 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":28,"start":47519.06399999999,"end":48617.67599999999,"title":"029 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":29,"start":48617.67599999999,"end":50062.96799999999,"title":"030 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":30,"start":50062.96799999999,"end":51139.907999999996,"title":"031 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":31,"start":51139.907999999996,"end":52914.42,"title":"032 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":32,"start":52914.42,"end":54168.587999999996,"title":"033 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":33,"start":54168.587999999996,"end":56394.827999999994,"title":"034 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":34,"start":56394.827999999994,"end":57136.06799999999,"title":"035 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":35,"start":57136.06799999999,"end":57332.91599999999,"title":"036 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":36,"start":57332.91599999999,"end":57379.53599999999,"title":"037 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"},{"id":37,"start":57379.53599999999,"end":58918.17599999999,"title":"038 Leigh Bardugo (2019) Ninth House"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw13ya6e","ino":"5645240111439350437","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Sixteen Ways to Defend a Walled City","subtitle":null,"author":"K.

But for Aedan, a scruffy young adventurer with veins full of fire and a head full of ideas, this officer is not what he seems. The events that follow propel Aedan on a journey that only the foolhardy or desperate would risk, leading him to the gates of the nation's royal academy - a whole world of secrets in itself. But this is only the beginning of his discoveries. Something is stirring in the land, something more ominous than the rising threat of hostile nations. Fearful travelers whisper of an ancient power breathing over Thirna, changing it, waking it. In the very heart of these stirrings, Aedan encounters that which defies belief, leaving him speechless with terror - and

After the gods warred and drove themselves to extinction, the cataclysm of their fall shattered the land of Vigrið. Now a new world is rising, where power-hungry jarls feud and monsters stalk the woods and mountains. A world where the bones of the dead gods still hold great power for those brave - or desperate - enough to seek them out.   As whispers of war echo across the mountains and fjords, fate follows in the footsteps of three people: a huntress on a dangerous quest, a noblewoman who has rejected privilege in pursuit of battle fame and a thrall who seeks vengeance among the famed mercenaries known as the Bloodsworn.  All three will shape the fate of the world as it once more falls under the shadow of the gods....","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw16087h/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637011039489,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"John Gwynne/The Shadow of the Gods","fullPath":"/audiobooks/John Gwynne/The Shadow of the Gods","addedAt":1637010871134,"lastUpdate":1637011039490,"duration":65692040,"size":604055281,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":55,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":14.805,"title":"The Shadow of the Gods -

After being murdered by a mystery assailant, navigating his way through the realm between life and death, and being brought back to the mortal world, Harry realizes that maybe death wasn’t all that bad - because he is no longer Harry Dresden, Chicago’s only professional wizard. He is now Harry Dresden, Winter Knight to Mab, the Queen of Air and Darkness. After Harry had no choice but to swear his fealty, Mab wasn’t about to let something as petty as death steal away the prize she had sought for so long. And now, her word is his command, no matter what she wants him to do, no matter where she wants him to go, and no matter who she wants him to kill. Guess which one Mab wants first? Of course, it won’t be an ordinary, everyday assassination. Mab wants her newest minion to pull off the impossible: kill an immortal. No problem there, right? And to make matters worse, there exists a growing threat to an unfathomable source of magic that could land Harry in the sort of trouble that will make death look like a holiday. Beset by enemies new and old, Harry must gather his friends and allies, prevent the annihilation of countless innocents, and find a way out of his eternal subservience before his newfound powers claim the only thing he has left to call his own… his soul.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw16hi02/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Mystery"],"lastUpdate":1637016195207,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Jim Butcher/The Dresden Files 14 - Cold Days","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Jim Butcher/The Dresden Files 14 - Cold Days","addedAt":1637011676073,"lastUpdate":1637016195207,"duration":67729327,"size":597709821,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":3,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":21735.266,"title":"Jim Butcher - Cold Days 01"},{"id":1,"start":21735.266,"end":44469.543999999994,"title":"Jim Butcher - Cold Days 02"},{"id":2,"start":44469.543999999994,"end":67729.32699999999,"title":"Jim Butcher - Cold Days 03"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw16hn29","ino":"5331703255724704930","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Ghost Story","subtitle":null,"author":"Jim Butcher","authorFL":"Jim Butcher","authorLF":"Butcher, Jim","narrator":"James Marsters","series":"The Dresden Files","volumeNumber":"13","publishYear":"2012","publisher":null,"description":"When an unknown someone shoots him and leaves him to die, Harry Dresden hopes he might be heading to a better place.

No evildoers have tried to flatten him in weeks, his marriage to Mary Jane is stronger than ever, and he's enjoying his job as a high-school science teacher. Life is good. Naturally, that doesn't last. When Peter learns that his old enemy, the Rhino, is on a rampage in Times Square, he suits up as Spider-Man to stop the destructive villain in his tracks. But he's unexpectedly foiled in his attempts by the Black Cat, a former ally and old flame. The Cat informs Peter that the Rhino is just a distraction - the real threat comes from a group of Ancients, members of the same race as the being called Morlun, who Spidey defeated in battle years earlier.

Alaric, who betrayed everything he believed to save his wife - and still failed.

The adventuring industry drives the economy of Arth, a world much like our own but with more magic and fewer vowels. Monsters' hoards are claimed, bought by corporate interests, and sold off to plunder funds long before the Heroes' Guild actually kills the beasts. Of course, that's a terrible arrangement for the Shadowkin; orcs, goblins, kobolds, and their ilk must apply for to become Noncombatant Paper Carriers (or NPCs) to avoid being killed and looted by heroes. When Gorm Ingerson, a Dwarven ex-hero with a checkered past, stands up for an undocumented goblin, he inadvertently singles himself out for recruitment by a prophet of the mad goddess to undertake a suicidal quest. But there's more to Gorm's new job than an insane prophecy: powerful corporations and governments have shown an unusual interest in the quest. If his party of eccentric misfits can stop fighting each other long enough to recover the Elven Marbles, Gorm might be able to turn a bad deal into a golden opportunity.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw1fk0r5/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/J.

Thompson introduced the world to \"gonzo journalism\" with this cult classic that shot back up the best seller lists after Thompson's suicide in 2005. No book ever written has more perfectly captured the spirit of the 1960s counterculture. In Las Vegas to cover a motorcycle race, Raoul Duke (Thompson) and his attorney Dr. Gonzo (inspired by a friend of Thompson) are quickly diverted to search for the American dream. Their quest is fueled by nearly every drug imaginable and quickly becomes a surreal experience that blurs the line between reality and fantasy. But there is more to this hilarious tale than reckless behavior, for underneath the hallucinogenic facade is a stinging criticism of American greed and consumerism.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1fr4bo/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Biographies & Memoirs","Art & Literature"],"lastUpdate":1637027374432,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Hunter S Thompson/Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Hunter S Thompson/Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas","addedAt":1637027242253,"lastUpdate":1637027374432,"duration":21623468,"size":133514239,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":24,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":923.272,"title":"01 of 24 - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter Thompson"},{"id":1,"start":923.272,"end":1816.739,"title":"02 of 24 - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter Thompson"},{"id":2,"start":1816.739,"end":2732.018,"title":"03 of 24 - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter Thompson"},{"id":3,"start":2732.018,"end":3640.583,"title":"04 of 24 - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter Thompson"},{"id":4,"start":3640.583,"end":4551.186,"title":"05 of 24 - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter Thompson"},{"id":5,"start":4551.186,"end":5448.884,"title":"06 of 24 - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter Thompson"},{"id":6,"start":5448.884,"end":6348.986,"title":"07 of 24 - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter Thompson"},{"id":7,"start":6348.986,"end":7242.4529999999995,"title":"08 of 24 - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter Thompson"},{"id":8,"start":7242.4529999999995,"end":8135.866999999999,"title":"09 of 24 - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter Thompson"},{"id":9,"start":8135.866999999999,"end":9037.223,"title":"10 of 24 - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter Thompson"},{"id":10,"start":9037.223,"end":9931.943,"title":"11 of 24 - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter Thompson"},{"id":11,"start":9931.943,"end":10827.264,"title":"12 of 24 - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter Thompson"},{"id":12,"start":10827.264,"end":11725.823999999999,"title":"13 of 24 - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter Thompson"},{"id":13,"start":11725.823999999999,"end":12621.562999999998,"title":"14 of 24 - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter Thompson"},{"id":14,"start":12621.562999999998,"end":13521.194999999998,"title":"15 of 24 - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter Thompson"},{"id":15,"start":13521.194999999998,"end":14424.979999999998,"title":"16 of 24 - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter Thompson"},{"id":16,"start":14424.979999999998,"end":15318.524999999998,"title":"17 of 24 - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter Thompson"},{"id":17,"start":15318.524999999998,"end":16222.753999999997,"title":"18 of 24 - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter Thompson"},{"id":18,"start":16222.753999999997,"end":17117.552999999996,"title":"19 of 24 - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter Thompson"},{"id":19,"start":17117.552999999996,"end":18012.220999999998,"title":"20 of 24 - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter Thompson"},{"id":20,"start":18012.220999999998,"end":18914.961,"title":"21 of 24 - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter Thompson"},{"id":21,"start":18914.961,"end":19809.132999999998,"title":"22 of 24 - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter Thompson"},{"id":22,"start":19809.132999999998,"end":20706.595999999998,"title":"23 of 24 - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter Thompson"},{"id":23,"start":20706.595999999998,"end":21623.467999999997,"title":"24 of 24 - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter Thompson"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1gaaxx","ino":"17617982776364565646","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"The Summer Tree","subtitle":null,"author":"Guy Gavriel Kay","authorFL":"Guy Gavriel Kay","authorLF":"Kay, Guy Gavriel","narrator":"Simon Vance","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2001","publisher":null,"description":"Two-time Aurora Award-winning author Guy Gavriel Kay has been nominated for the World Fantasy Award three times.

And the stories of those soldiers are the stories of Glen Cook's hugely popular Black Company novels. If the Joseph Heller of Catch-22 were to tell the story of The Lord of the Rings, it might read like the Black Company books. There is nothing else in fantasy like them. Now, at last, Cook brings the Glittering Stone cycle within the Black Company series to an end... but an end with many other tales left to tell. As Soldiers Live opens, Croaker is military dictator of all the Taglias, and no Black Company member has died in battle for four years. Croaker figures it can't last. He's right. For, of course, many of the Company's old adversaries are still around. Narayan Singh and his adopted daughter - actually the offspring of Croaker and the Lady - hope to bring about the apocalyptic Year of the Skulls. Other old enemies like Shadowcatcher, Longshadow, and Howler are also ready to do the Company harm. And much of the Company is still recovering from the 15 years many of them spent in a stasis field. Then a report arrives of an evil spirit, a forvalaka, that has taken over one of their old enemies. It attacks them at a shadowgate - setting off a chain of events that will bring the Company to the edge of apocalypse and, as usual, several steps beyond. Glen Cook is the leading modern writer of epic fantasy noir, and Soldiers Live is Cook at his best. None of his legion of fans will want to miss it.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw1hzs39/10 - Soldiers Live.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Glen Cook/Soldiers Live/10 - Soldiers Live.jpg","genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637031011259,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Glen Cook/Soldiers Live","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Glen Cook/Soldiers Live","addedAt":1637031005564,"lastUpdate":1637037653580,"duration":70239087,"size":857065272,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":3,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":23613.806,"title":"Soldiers Live unabridged part1"},{"id":1,"start":23613.806,"end":47241.195999999996,"title":"Soldiers Live unabridged part2"},{"id":2,"start":47241.195999999996,"end":70239.087,"title":"Soldiers Live unabridged part3"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1ifmj0","ino":"8924279687092900862","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Shadow Games","subtitle":null,"author":"Glen Cook","authorFL":"Glen Cook","authorLF":"Cook, Glen","narrator":"Marc Vietor","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"1989","publisher":null,"description":"After the devastating battle at the Tower of Charm, Croaker leads the greatly diminished Black Company south, in search of the lost Annals.

Every step of the way, the Company is hounded by shadowy figured and carrion-eating crows. As they march every southward, through bug infested jungle; rivers dense with bloodthirsty pirates; and cities, dead and living, haunted by the passage of the Company north, their numbers grow until they are thousands strong. But always they are watched by the Shadowmasters, a deadly new enemy. They are twisted creatures that deal in darkness and death, powerful, shadowy creatures bent on smothering the world in their foul embrace.

Angrboda’s story begins where most witches' tales end: with a burning. A punishment from Odin for refusing to provide him with knowledge of the future, the fire leaves Angrboda injured and powerless, and she flees into the farthest reaches of a remote forest. There she is found by a man who reveals himself to be Loki, and her initial distrust of him transforms into a deep and abiding love. Their union produces three unusual children, each with a secret destiny, who Angrboda is keen to raise at the edge of the world, safely hidden from Odin’s all-seeing eye. But as Angrboda slowly recovers her prophetic powers, she learns that her blissful life - and possibly all of existence - is in danger. With help from the fierce huntress Skadi, with whom she shares a growing bond, Angrboda must choose whether she’ll accept the fate that she’s foreseen for her beloved family...or rise to remake their future. From the most ancient of tales this novel forges a story of love, loss, and hope for the modern age.

On the island of Kekon, the Kaul family is locked in a violent feud for control of the capital city and the supply of magical jade that endows trained Green Bone warriors with supernatural powers they alone have possessed for hundreds of years. Beyond Kekon's borders, war is brewing. Powerful foreign governments and mercenary criminal kingpins alike turn their eyes on the island nation. Jade, Kekon's most prized resource, could make them rich - or give them the edge they'd need to topple their rivals. Faced with threats on all sides, the Kaul family is forced to form new and dangerous alliances, confront enemies in the darkest streets and the tallest office towers, and put honor aside in order to do whatever it takes to ensure their own survival - and that of all the Green Bones of Kekon.  Jade War is the second book of the Green Bone Saga, an epic trilogy about family, honor, and those who live and die by the ancient laws of blood and jade.

Break the Code. Shatter the World. Centuries ago, the murder of a beloved king tore apart the Kingdom of Caledun. The land was plunged into chaos and thousands perished in the aftermath. A new order was established in an attempt to return Caledun to its former glory. It failed, but in its place rose the beginnings of the Code.  During this same period, the mystical caretakers of the Great Wood retreated from the world of Kal Maran, their disappearance an ominous harbinger of the suffering that was to follow. The Great Wood now grows out of control. Cities, towns, and villages have fallen before the relentless march of the forest. Without the former guardians to keep her tame, the wood has become a place of peril, and dark creatures of legend now hunt beneath its leaves.  The summer season is now a time of armed conflict. The fall of the old monarchy has brought about a ceaseless cycle of combat. Grievances are settled by the strict tenets of a binding Mercenary Code and the men who would die to preserve its honour.  However, change is in the air. Political rivalries have escalated, and dire rumblings of a revolution abound. Thrust to the forefront of the shattered land's politics, a mercenary fights for more than just riches. In the north, a borderland soldier wrestles with his own demons and looks to find his true purpose.

corporate-funded education. Burdened by a crushing debt that rules out college, Tanner enlists in the navy of Archangel, a star system with four terraformed worlds. But he hasn't factored in the space pirates. Just as Tanner begins basic training, the government ramps up its forces to confront a band of rowdy raiders who are wreaking havoc in the void. Led by complex and charismatic Captain Casey, the outlaws love a little murder and mayhem, but they are also democratic, egalitarian, and devoted to freeing each new recruit from debt and corporate oppression. Assigned to the front lines, Tanner soon finds himself caught in the crossfire between ruthless foes, cruel comrades, and unforgiving space. Can he do his duty when good and evil look so much alike?","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1lm2t7/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Science Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637037198792,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Elliott Kay/Poor Man's Fight","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Elliott Kay/Poor Man's Fight","addedAt":1637037084733,"lastUpdate":1637037198792,"duration":50397342,"size":402440841,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":18,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":29.49,"title":"Opening Credits"},{"id":1,"start":29.49,"end":1250.117,"title":"Prologue At War with the World"},{"id":2,"start":1250.117,"end":4157.256,"title":"One The Test"},{"id":3,"start":4157.256,"end":7407.493,"title":"Two Theater"},{"id":4,"start":7407.493,"end":10210.653,"title":"Three Oscar"},{"id":5,"start":10210.653,"end":13393.877,"title":"Four The Education of Darren Mills"},{"id":6,"start":13393.877,"end":18477.190000000002,"title":"Five Hit Me"},{"id":7,"start":18477.190000000002,"end":21318.338000000003,"title":"Six The Only Constant"},{"id":8,"start":21318.338000000003,"end":25917.654000000002,"title":"Seven Predators"},{"id":9,"start":25917.654000000002,"end":29791.857000000004,"title":"Eight Boot"},{"id":10,"start":29791.857000000004,"end":31766.018000000004,"title":"Nine Good Enough for Government Work"},{"id":11,"start":31766.018000000004,"end":34909.257000000005,"title":"Ten Things Will Go Wrong"},{"id":12,"start":34909.257000000005,"end":37244.442,"title":"Eleven Is This All There Is"},{"id":13,"start":37244.442,"end":39471.608,"title":"Twelve Breaking Point"},{"id":14,"start":39471.608,"end":41781.762,"title":"Thirteen Oscar’s in the Water"},{"id":15,"start":41781.762,"end":45244.972,"title":"Fourteen No Such Thing as a Fair Fight"},{"id":16,"start":45244.972,"end":48517.175,"title":"Fifteen Monsters"},{"id":17,"start":48517.175,"end":50397.342000000004,"title":"Sixteen Above and Beyond"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1lt4hi","ino":"17276649523041147118","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Dead Man's Debt","subtitle":null,"author":"Elliott Kay","authorFL":"Elliott Kay","authorLF":"Kay, Elliott","narrator":"Tim Pabon","series":"Poor Man's Fight","volumeNumber":"3","publishYear":"2016","publisher":null,"description":"\"We require a different battlefield.\" Nobody expected the war to last three hours, let alone three years.

Faced with this grim truth, Archangel's leaders shift their strategy to diplomacy and espionage. For both arenas, they call upon a reluctant weapon: a frontline grunt named Tanner Malone. These days Tanner doesn't aspire to win the war. He merely wants to survive it. Now he'll be thrust into the center of events once again, pulled back and forth from covert missions to the media spotlight. Yet with every battle, he gets closer to the old enemy hidden in the shadows and the ugly truth about the war that could unravel everything Archangel might hope to win.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1lt4hi/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Science Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637037475318,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Elliott Kay/Dead Man's Debt","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Elliott Kay/Dead Man's Debt","addedAt":1637037412777,"lastUpdate":1637037475318,"duration":59398418,"size":472441474,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":19,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":11.285,"title":"Opening Credits"},{"id":1,"start":11.285,"end":1070.719,"title":"Prologue The Deal"},{"id":2,"start":1070.719,"end":3283.488,"title":"Chapter One Enemies on All Sides"},{"id":3,"start":3283.488,"end":7072.01,"title":"Chapter Two The Status Quo"},{"id":4,"start":7072.01,"end":11434.761,"title":"Chapter Three Fishing"},{"id":5,"start":11434.761,"end":14766.036,"title":"Chapter Four There But for the Grace of God"},{"id":6,"start":14766.036,"end":18410.362,"title":"Chapter Five Reunions"},{"id":7,"start":18410.362,"end":21080.843,"title":"Chapter Six No Time for Hurt Feelings"},{"id":8,"start":21080.843,"end":25014.350000000002,"title":"Chapter Seven Misdirection"},{"id":9,"start":25014.350000000002,"end":28759.590000000004,"title":"Chapter Eight Say It to My Face"},{"id":10,"start":28759.590000000004,"end":32148.125000000004,"title":"Chapter Nine Invitations"},{"id":11,"start":32148.125000000004,"end":35869.495,"title":"Chapter Ten Never According to Plan"},{"id":12,"start":35869.495,"end":38443.985,"title":"Chapter Eleven Personal Initiative"},{"id":13,"start":38443.985,"end":41146.231,"title":"Chapter Twelve How to Make an Entrance"},{"id":14,"start":41146.231,"end":44868.901,"title":"Chapter Thirteen Sacrifice"},{"id":15,"start":44868.901,"end":47495.774999999994,"title":"Chapter Fourteen Dirty Enough to be True"},{"id":16,"start":47495.774999999994,"end":53166.36699999999,"title":"Chapter Fifteen Rollercoasters"},{"id":17,"start":53166.36699999999,"end":58139.384999999995,"title":"Chapter Sixteen It’s Not About You"},{"id":18,"start":58139.384999999995,"end":59398.418,"title":"Epilogue Swagger"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1n3cii","ino":"5555845072574225878","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"A Warrior's Knowledge","subtitle":null,"author":"Davis Ashura","authorFL":"Davis Ashura","authorLF":"Ashura, Davis","narrator":"Nick Podehl","series":"Castes and the OutCastes","volumeNumber":"2","publishYear":"2014","publisher":null,"description":"With A Warrior's Path, Davis Ashura introduced fans to Arisa, an ancient world rich with history and myth where humanity struggles to survive the never-ending battle with the demon Suwraith and her hordes of Chimeras. Now Ashura's best-selling epic continues with A Warrior's Knowledge. Rukh Shektan and Jessira Grey struggle to reach the OutCaste city of Stronghold before winter's snow bars all passages. Their travels test Rukh's will and hope as Chimeras hound their footsteps, but the most difficult challenge proves to be Stronghold itself. The city is not as Jessira described. Rector Bryce and Mira Terrell form a reluctant alliance. Rector is forced to do the bidding of Dar'El Shektan - the man he betrayed - and works with Mira. They seek a means to bring down House Shektan's most bitter rival, Hal'El Wrestiva, the man responsible for Rukh's banishment. Meanwhile, Bree and Jaresh continue their search for the Sil Lor Kum. Danger lurks, and the withering knife murders continue as Hal'El Wrestiva, the SuDin of the Sil Lor Kum, furthers his own intentions. And high in the heavens and watching over the world is Suwraith. Her clouded mind is clear for the first time in millennia, and she makes her own plans. The sorrow bringer has learned of Stronghold's existence.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1n3cii/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":"/metadata/books/kw1n3cii/cover.jpg","genres":["Teen & Young Adult","Science Fiction & Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637039788799,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Davis Ashura/A Warrior's Knowledge","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Davis Ashura/A Warrior's Knowledge","addedAt":1637039569837,"lastUpdate":1637039788799,"duration":66346016,"size":812056109,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":37,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":15.929,"title":"A Warriors Knowledge -

Cinder Shade’s life begins on a fateful afternoon at the bottom of a well where he awakens, bruised, battered, and bereft of all memory. His only understanding is a driving imperative to protect those who can’t defend themselves and become a warrior worthy of the name.  He discovers within himself a peculiar gift, one in which the codes of combat are made evident and the language of steel is made clear. When he earns a place at a prestigious elven warrior academy, Cinder fights to enhance his knowledge and perhaps even humble the proud elves who believe no human is their equal. His hard-earned skills are put to the test when strange rumblings emanate from deep in the Dagger Mountains. Monsters out of myth emerge. And so does something far worse... An ancient god. The world believes this deity long dead, but he is very much alive. And he remembers his enemies all too well. Even if they don’t remember themselves.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1n725m/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Action & Adventure"],"lastUpdate":1637039872745,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Davis Ashura/A Testament of Steel","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Davis Ashura/A Testament of Steel","addedAt":1637039743057,"lastUpdate":1637039872745,"duration":70295371,"size":431044029,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":41,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":18.992,"title":"A Testament of Steel Instrument of Omens, Book 1 -

Perfect for fans of Lord of the Rings, the New York Times best-selling Inheritance Cycle about the dragon rider Eragon has sold over 35 million copies and is an international fantasy sensation. Oaths sworn...loyalties tested...forces collide.  Following the colossal battle against the Empire’s warriors on the Burning Plains, Eragon and his dragon, Saphira, have narrowly escaped with their lives. Still there is more at hand for the Rider and his dragon, as Eragon finds himself bound by a tangle of promises he may not be able to keep. First is Eragon’s oath to his cousin Roran: to help rescue Roran’s beloved, Katrina, from King Galbatorix’s clutches. But Eragon owes his loyalty to others, too. The Varden are in desperate need of his talents and strength - as are the elves and dwarves. When unrest claims the rebels and danger strikes from every corner, Eragon must make choices - choices that take him across the Empire and beyond, choices that may lead to unimagined sacrifice. Eragon is the greatest hope to rid the land of tyranny. Can this once-simple farm boy unite the rebel forces and defeat the king?","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1oczpi/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Teen & Young Adult","Literature & Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637042338399,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Christopher Paolini/Inheritance 03 -

Thomas, a disgraced knight, has found a young girl alone in a dead Norman village. An orphan of the Black Death, and an almost unnerving picture of innocence, she tells Thomas that plague is only part of a larger cataclysm - that the fallen angels under Lucifer are rising in a second war on heaven, and that the world of men has fallen behind the lines of conflict. Is it delirium or is it faith? She believes she has seen the angels of God. She believes the righteous dead speak to her in dreams. And now she has convinced the faithless Thomas to shepherd her across a depraved landscape to Avignon. There, she tells Thomas, she will fulfill her mission: to confront the evil that has devastated the earth and to restore to this betrayed, murderous knight the nobility and hope of salvation he long abandoned. As Hell unleashes its wrath, and as the true nature of the girl is revealed, Thomas will find himself on a macabre battleground of angels, demons, saints, and the risen dead - and in the midst of a desperate struggle for nothing less than the soul of man. Christopher Buehlman is a writer and performer from St. Petersburg, Florida. The winner of the 2007 Bridport Prize for poetry, he is also the author of several plays and the acclaimed horror novel Those Across the River. He lives with his wife and his rescued dog, Duck.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1pj4so/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Classics"],"lastUpdate":1637043788968,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Christopher Buehlman/Between Two Fires","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Christopher Buehlman/Between Two Fires","addedAt":1637043665522,"lastUpdate":1637043788968,"duration":51993144,"size":463099640,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":28,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":1865.196,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 01-28"},{"id":1,"start":1865.196,"end":3726.828,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 02-28"},{"id":2,"start":3726.828,"end":5590.836,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 03-28"},{"id":3,"start":5590.836,"end":7455.6720000000005,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 04-28"},{"id":4,"start":7455.6720000000005,"end":9318.312,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 05-28"},{"id":5,"start":9318.312,"end":11201.256,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 06-28"},{"id":6,"start":11201.256,"end":13067.207999999999,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 07-28"},{"id":7,"start":13067.207999999999,"end":14930.855999999998,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 08-28"},{"id":8,"start":14930.855999999998,"end":16795.656,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 09-28"},{"id":9,"start":16795.656,"end":18668.448,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 10-28"},{"id":10,"start":18668.448,"end":20532.384000000002,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 11-28"},{"id":11,"start":20532.384000000002,"end":22397.976000000002,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 12-28"},{"id":12,"start":22397.976000000002,"end":24259.680000000004,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 13-28"},{"id":13,"start":24259.680000000004,"end":26123.616000000005,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 14-28"},{"id":14,"start":26123.616000000005,"end":28002.492000000006,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 15-28"},{"id":15,"start":28002.492000000006,"end":29865.852000000006,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 16-28"},{"id":16,"start":29865.852000000006,"end":31731.696000000007,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 17-28"},{"id":17,"start":31731.696000000007,"end":33593.47200000001,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 18-28"},{"id":18,"start":33593.47200000001,"end":35457.73200000001,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 19-28"},{"id":19,"start":35457.73200000001,"end":37320.94800000001,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 20-28"},{"id":20,"start":37320.94800000001,"end":39188.05200000001,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 21-28"},{"id":21,"start":39188.05200000001,"end":41060.70000000001,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 22-28"},{"id":22,"start":41060.70000000001,"end":42923.84400000001,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 23-28"},{"id":23,"start":42923.84400000001,"end":44787.02400000001,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 24-28"},{"id":24,"start":44787.02400000001,"end":46654.52400000001,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 25-28"},{"id":25,"start":46654.52400000001,"end":48517.41600000001,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 26-28"},{"id":26,"start":48517.41600000001,"end":50379.19200000001,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 27-28"},{"id":27,"start":50379.19200000001,"end":51993.14400000001,"title":"Christopher Buehlman - Between Two Fires 28-28"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1pys4f","ino":"14630687826364115581","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Iron Prince","subtitle":"Stormweaver, Book 1","author":"Bryce O'Connor","authorFL":"Bryce O'Connor","authorLF":"O'Connor, Bryce","narrator":"Luke Daniels","series":"Stormweaver Series","volumeNumber":"1","publishYear":"2020","publisher":null,"description":"Reidon Ward will become a god. He doesn't know it yet, of course. Reidon was born weak, sickly, and small. Afflicted with a painful disease and abandoned by his parents because of it, he has had to fight tooth and nail for every minor advantage life has allowed him. However, his perseverance has not gone unnoticed, and when the most powerful artificial intelligence in human history takes an interest in him, things began to change quickly. Granted a CAD - a Combat Assistance Device - with awful specs but an infinite potential for growth, Reidon finds himself at the bottom of his class at the Galens Institute, one of the top military academies in the Collective. Along with his best friend, Viviana Arada, Reidon will have to start his long climb through the school rankings and on to the combat tournament circuits that have become humanity's greatest source of excitement and entertainment.

published in 1987 it catapulted author Brian Jacques to international stardom. And small wonder! This enthralling tale is jam-packed with the things we long for in a great adventure: danger, laughter, hairbreadth escapes, tragedy, mystery, a touch of wonder, a truly despicable villain, and a hero we can take to heart. That hero is Matthias, a young mouse who must rise above his fears and failures to save his friends at Redwall Abbey. The villain is Cluny the Scourge, one of the most deliciously despicable rats of all time. The unforgettable cast of supporting characters includes the stalwart badger Constance, an irrepressible hare named Basil Stag Hare, and the elderly wisemouse Brother Methuselah. But most of all there is Matthias, seeking his true destiny in a journey that will lead through danger and despair to true wisdom.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1qwwvg/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Children's Audiobooks","Science Fiction &

Neither side has gained an advantage, and the threat of a betrayal by Dalinar’s crafty ally Taravangian looms over every strategic move.  Now, as new technological discoveries by Navani Kholin’s scholars begin to change the face of the war, the enemy prepares a bold and dangerous operation. The arms race that follows will challenge the very core of the Radiant ideals and potentially reveal the secrets of the ancient tower that was once the heart of their strength. At the same time that Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with his changing role within the Knights Radiant, his Windrunners face their own problem: As more and more deadly enemy Fused awaken to wage war, no more honorspren are willing to bond with humans to increase the number of Radiants. Adolin and Shallan must lead the coalition’s envoy to the honorspren stronghold of Lasting Integrity and either convince the spren to join the cause against the evil god Odium or personally face the storm of failure.  Barnes and Noble Best New Books of the Year - 2020 A Macmillan Audio production from Tor

story of political intrigue and magical, martial-arts action.  For a thousand years the ash fell and no flowers bloomed. For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the \"Sliver of Infinity,\" reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison.  Kelsier \"snapped\" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark. Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot. But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life.  Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets, and gotten it. She will have to learn to trust, if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed.  This saga dares to ask a simple question: What if the hero of prophecy fails?

My only concerns in life were how to avoid a transfer to the Case Progression Unit - we do paperwork so real coppers don't have to - and finding a way to climb into the panties of the outrageously perky WPC Leslie May. Then one night, in pursuance of a murder inquiry, I tried to take a witness statement from someone who was dead but disturbingly voluble, and that brought me to the attention of Inspector Nightingale, the last wizard in England.  Now I'm a Detective Constable and a trainee wizard, the first apprentice in 50 years, and my world has become somewhat more complicated: nests of vampires in Purley, negotiating a truce between the warring god and goddess of the Thames, and digging up graves in Covent Garden...and there's something festering at the heart of the city I love, a malicious, vengeful spirit that takes ordinary Londoners and twists them into grotesque mannequins to act out its drama of violence and despair. The spirit of riot and rebellion has awakened in the city, and it's falling to me to bring order out of chaos - or die trying.

And it's why, when Dr Walid called me to the morgue to listen to a corpse, I recognised the tune it was playing. Something violently supernatural had happened to the victim, strong enough to leave its imprint like a wax cylinder recording. Cyrus Wilkinson, part-time jazz saxophonist and full-time accountant, had apparently dropped dead of a heart attack just after finishing a gig in a Soho jazz club. He wasn't the first.  No one was going to let me exhume corpses to see if they were playing my tune, so it was back to old-fashioned legwork, starting in Soho, the heart of the scene. I didn't trust the lovely Simone, Cyrus' ex-lover, professional jazz kitten and as inviting as a Rubens portrait, but I needed her help: there were monsters stalking Soho, creatures feeding off that special gift that separates the great musician from someone who can raise a decent tune. What they take is beauty. What they leave behind is sickness, failure and broken lives. And as I hunted them, my investigation got tangled up in another story: a brilliant trumpet player, Richard 'Lord' Grant - my father - who managed to destroy his own career, twice. That's the thing about policing: most of the time you're doing it to maintain public order. Occasionally you're doing it for justice. And maybe once in a career, you're doing it for revenge.

But even as the unwieldy might of the Metropolitan Police bears down on its foe, Peter uncovers clues that Chorley, far from being finished, is executing the final stages of a long-term plan. A plan that has its roots in London's 2,000 bloody years of history and could literally bring the city to its knees. To save his beloved city, Peter's going to need help from his former best friend and colleague - Lesley May - who brutally betrayed him and everything he thought she believed in.

Steering souls through the subtleties of word and expression, Kellhus strives to extend his dominion over the Men of the Tusk. The sorcerer Achamian and his lover, Esmenet, submit entirely, only to have their faith - and their love - tested in unimaginable ways. Meanwhile, the warrior Cnaiur falls ever deeper into madness. Convinced that Kellhus will betray their pact to murder his father, Cnaiur turns to the agents of the Second Apocalypse and strikes an infernal bargain. The Holy War stands on a knife edge. If all is not to be lost, the great powers of the world will have to choose between their most desperate desires and the end of the world. Between hatred and hope.

For nearly 2,000 years, only one Druid has walked the Earth - Atticus O'Sullivan, the Iron Druid, whose sharp wit and sharp sword have kept him alive as he's been pursued by a pantheon of hostile deities. Now he's got company. Atticus' apprentice, Granuaile, is at last a full Druid herself. What's more, Atticus has defrosted an archdruid long ago frozen in time, a father figure (of sorts) who now goes by the modern equivalent of his old Irish name: Owen Kennedy. And Owen has some catching up to do. Atticus takes pleasure in the role reversal, as the student is now the teacher. Between busting Atticus's chops and trying to fathom a cell phone, Owen must also learn English. For Atticus, the jury's still out on whether the wily old coot will be an asset in the epic battle with Norse god Loki - or merely a pain in the arse. But Atticus isn't the only one with daddy issues. Granuaile faces a great challenge: to exorcise a sorcerer's spirit that is possessing her father in India. Even with the help of the witch Laksha, Granuaile may be facing a crushing defeat. As the trio of Druids deals with pestilence-spreading demons, bacon-loving yeti, fierce flying foxes, and frenzied Fae, they're hoping that this time, three's a charm.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw21r73p/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Action & Adventure"],"lastUpdate":1637087633235,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Kevin Hearne/Iron Druid/07 - Shattered","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Kevin Hearne/Iron Druid/07 - Shattered","addedAt":1637064197166,"lastUpdate":1637087633235,"duration":41746414,"size":676738108,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":1,"chapters":[],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw21s185","ino":"14667316769642718876","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"\nHammered","subtitle":null,"author":"Kevin Hearne","authorFL":"Kevin Hearne","authorLF":"Hearne, Kevin","narrator":"Luke Daniels","series":"Iron Druid","volumeNumber":"3","publishYear":"2011","publisher":null,"description":"BOOK 3 IN THE IRON DRUID CHRONICLES Thor, the Norse god of thunder, is worse than a blowhard and a bully - he’s ruined countless lives and killed scores of innocents. After centuries, Viking vampire Leif Helgarson is ready to get his vengeance, and he’s asked his friend Atticus O’Sullivan, the last of the Druids, to help take down this Norse nightmare. One survival strategy has worked for Atticus for more than two thousand years: stay away from the guy with the lightning bolts. But things are heating up in Atticus’s home base of Tempe, Arizona. There’s a vampire turf war brewing, and Russian demon hunters who call themselves the Hammers of God are running rampant. Despite multiple warnings and portents of dire consequences, Atticus and Leif journey to the Norse plain of Asgard, where they team up with a werewolf, a sorcerer, and an army of frost giants for an epic showdown against vicious Valkyries, angry gods, and the hammer-wielding Thunder Thug himself.

They plan to bring Asroth and his host of the Fallen into the world of flesh, but to do so they need the seven treasures. Nathair has been deceived but now he knows the truth. He has choices to make, choices that will determine the fate of the Banished Lands.  Elsewhere the flame of resistance is growing - Queen Edana finds allies in the swamps of Ardan. Maquin is loose in Tenebral, hunted by Lykos and his corsairs. Here he will witness the birth of a rebellion in Nathair's own realm.  Corban has been swept along by the tide of war. He has suffered, lost loved ones, sought only safety from the darkness. But he will run no more. He has seen the face of evil and he has set his will to fight it. The question is, how?  With a disparate band gathered about him - his family, friends, giants, fanatical warriors, an angel and a talking crow he begins the journey to Drassil, the fabled fortress hidden deep in the heart of Forn Forest. For in Drassil lies the spear of Skald, one of the seven treasures, and here it is prophesied that the Bright Star will stand against the Black Sun.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw23b7az/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/John Gwynne/Faithful and the Fallen/03 -

In a land where three suns almost never set, a ruthless assassin continues her quest for vengeance against the powers who destroyed her family. Mia Corvere has found her place among the Blades of Our Lady of Blessed Murder, but many in the Red Church hierarchy think she's far from earned it. Plying her bloody trade in a backwater of the Republic, she's no closer to ending the men who destroyed her familia; in fact she's told directly that Consul Scaeva is off limits. But after a deadly confrontation with an old enemy, Mia's suspicions about the Red Church's true motives begin to grow. When it's announced that Scaeva will be making a rare public appearance at the conclusion of the grand games in Godsgrave, Mia defies the Church and sells herself to a gladiatorial collegium for a chance to finally end him. Upon the sands of the arena, Mia finds new allies, bitter rivals, and more questions about her strange affinity for the shadows. But as conspiracies unfold within the collegium walls and the body count rises, Mia will be forced to choose between love and revenge and uncover a secret that could change the very face of her world.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw24d9ss/Godsgrave The Nevernight Chronicle, Book 2 (Unabridged).jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Jay Kristoff/Nevernight Chronicles/02 -

Years, book one: I never believed in the whole “light at the end of the tunnel” folly where people, after having a near-death experience, would startle awake in a cold sweat exclaiming, “I saw the light!” But there I was, in this so-called “tunnel” facing a glaring light, when the last thing I remembered was sleeping in my room - the royal bed-chamber, as others called it. Had I died? If so, how? King Grey once benefited from unrivaled strength, wealth, and prestige in a world governed by martial ability but now finds himself reborn in a society dominated by magic. Given a second chance at life, the once-king strives to understand his role in this new world and the purpose of his reincarnation while correcting the mistakes of his past. New Heights, book two: I had a family now, I had people who loved me. It was a feeling I never wanted to give up. I’d treasure it, fight for it if I had to...and for that, I needed to better myself. More so even than when I had been a king. Given a second chance at life, Arthur Leywin wishes above all to grow strong enough to protect his family, as the memory of his cold and disconnected past life as King Grey still haunts him. To this end, Arthur adopts the persona of the masked adventurer, Note, and delves into the dungeons under the forbidding Beast Glades. On his adventures, Arthur discovers a strange magical blade that responds to the dragon’s will inside him, befriends a powerful young conjurer whose past is shrouded in mystery, and battles the deadly Elderwood Guardian. Yet all his efforts might prove for naught when Arthur makes an enemy of a talented conjurer from a very powerful family, putting his very future at risk.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw09vk07/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction &

It’s Daisy Jones & The Six by Taylor Jenkins Reid, and it ROCKS. Literally.

It’s sex, drugs, and rock ‘n roll, people!! And the very best part?! Hello Sunshine is turning this into a TV show with Amazon Studios...so stay tuned for more updates!\" (Reese Witherspoon)   A gripping novel about the whirlwind rise of an iconic 1970s rock group and their beautiful lead singer, revealing the mystery behind their infamous breakup. Daisy is a girl coming of age in LA in the late '60s, sneaking into clubs on the Sunset Strip, sleeping with rock stars, and dreaming of singing at the Whisky a Go Go. The sex and drugs are thrilling, but it’s the rock ’n’ roll she loves most. By the time she’s 20, her voice is getting noticed, and she has the kind of heedless beauty that makes people do crazy things. Also getting noticed is The Six, a band led by the brooding Billy Dunne. On the eve of their first tour, his girlfriend Camila finds out she’s pregnant, and with the pressure of impending fatherhood and fame, Billy goes a little wild on the road. Daisy and Billy cross paths when a producer realizes that the key to supercharged success is to put the two together. What happens next will become the stuff of legend. The making of that legend is chronicled in this riveting and unforgettable novel, written as an oral history of one of the biggest bands of the '70s.

But the ingredients for such an antidote are scarce and located in the deepest wilds.  Together, Wu Ying and Elder Yang take it upon themselves to embark on a Second Expedition to acquire the necessary materials. It would be a dangerous journey through the State of Wei normally, but in the shadows, enemies await to finish the job. Wu Ying is once again pitched against dark forces as a Sect war looms.  The Second Expedition is book 4 of the A Thousand Li series which focuses on immortal cultivation, eastern philosophy, wondrous martial art styles, and spirit beasts. The series draws upon the long tradition of wuxia and xianxia works and will thrill those looking for such high flying fantasy. The Second Expedition is written by Tao Wong, the best-selling scifi and fantasy LitRPG author of the System Apocalypse, the Adventures on Brad and the Hidden Wishes

of my favorite fantasy series.” —George R. R. Martin • “Groundbreaking.” —Patrick Rothfuss • “One of the great fantasy epics of all time.” —Christopher Paolini Tad Williams introduced readers to the incredible fantasy world of Osten Ard in his internationally bestselling series Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn. The trilogy inspired a generation of modern fantasy writers, including George R.R. Martin, Patrick Rothfuss, and Christopher Paolini, and defined Tad Williams as one of the most important fantasy writers of our time. BOOK TWO: STONE OF FAREWELL It is a time of darkness, dread, and ultimate testing for the realm of Osten Ard, for the wild magic and terrifying minions of the undead Sithi ruler, Ineluki the Storm King, are spreading their seemingly undefeatable evil across the kingdom. With the very land blighted by the power of Ineluki’s wrath, the tattered remnants of a once-proud human army flee in search of a last sanctuary and rallying point—the Stone of Farewell, a place shrouded in mystery and ancient sorrow. An even as Prince Josua seeks to rally his scattered forces, Simon and the surviving members of the League of the Scroll are desperately struggling to discover the truth behind an almost-forgotten legend, which will take them from the fallen citadels of humans to the secret heartland of the Sithi—where near-immortals must at last decide whether to ally with the race of men in a final war against those of their own blood. After the landmark Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn trilogy, the epic saga of Osten Ard continues with the brand-new novel, The Heart of What Was Lost. Then don’t miss the upcoming trilogy, The Last King of Osten Ard, beginning with The Witchwood Crown! Praise for Osten Ard: \"Inspired me to write my own seven-book trilogy.... It’s one of my favorite fantasy series.\" —George R. R.

The Capitol keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.  Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to death before - and survival, for her, is second nature. Still, if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.  This special edition audiobook includes a bonus track Q&A with Tatiana Maslany!

Flames are spreading. And the Capitol wants revenge.  Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.  Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she’s afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she’s not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol’s cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can’t prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0db94g/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Teen & Young Adult","Literature & Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1636962683456,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Suzanne Collins/Catching Fire","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Suzanne Collins/Catching Fire","addedAt":1636962676706,"lastUpdate":1636962683456,"duration":39829184,"size":312408448,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":2,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":14.278,"title":"Chapter 0 (Track 1)"},{"id":1,"start":14.278,"end":1682.548,"title":"Chapter 1 (Track 2)"},{"id":2,"start":1682.548,"end":3033.568,"title":"Chapter 2 (Track 3)"},{"id":3,"start":3033.568,"end":4731.868,"title":"Chapter 3 (Track 4)"},{"id":4,"start":4731.868,"end":5710.838,"title":"Chapter 4 (Track 5)"},{"id":5,"start":5710.838,"end":6730.498,"title":"Chapter 5 (Track 6)"},{"id":6,"start":6730.498,"end":7934.388,"title":"Chapter 6 (Track 7)"},{"id":7,"start":7934.388,"end":9403.858,"title":"Chapter 7 (Track 8)"},{"id":8,"start":9403.858,"end":10978.698,"title":"Chapter 8 (Track 9)"},{"id":9,"start":10978.698,"end":12384.338,"title":"Chapter 9 (Track 10)"},{"id":10,"start":12384.338,"end":14014.378,"title":"Chapter 10 (Track 11)"},{"id":11,"start":14014.378,"end":15237.728,"title":"Chapter 11 (Track 12)"},{"id":12,"start":15237.728,"end":16531.128,"title":"Chapter 12 (Track 13)"},{"id":13,"start":16531.128,"end":17500.395,"title":"Chapter 13 (Track 14)"},{"id":14,"start":17500.395,"end":18917.175,"title":"Chapter 14 (Track 15)"},{"id":15,"start":18917.175,"end":20556.192,"title":"Chapter 15 (Track 16)"},{"id":16,"start":20556.192,"end":22015.172,"title":"Chapter 16 (Track 17)"},{"id":17,"start":22015.172,"end":23093.102,"title":"Chapter 17 (Track 18)"},{"id":18,"start":23093.102,"end":24040.851,"title":"Chapter 18 (Track 19)"},{"id":19,"start":24040.851,"end":25649.450999999997,"title":"Chapter 19 (Track 20)"},{"id":20,"start":25649.450999999997,"end":26807.121,"title":"Chapter 20 (Track 21)"},{"id":21,"start":26807.121,"end":28114.871,"title":"Chapter 21 (Track 22)"},{"id":22,"start":28114.871,"end":30030.811,"title":"Chapter 22 (Track 23)"},{"id":23,"start":30030.811,"end":31414.121,"title":"Chapter 23 (Track 24)"},{"id":24,"start":31414.121,"end":33028.531,"title":"Chapter 24 (Track 25)"},{"id":25,"start":33028.531,"end":34444.141,"title":"Chapter 25 (Track 26)"},{"id":26,"start":34444.141,"end":35990.241,"title":"Chapter 26 (Track 27)"},{"id":27,"start":35990.241,"end":37234.451,"title":"Chapter 27 (Track 28)"},{"id":28,"start":37234.451,"end":38420.291,"title":"Chapter 28 (Track 29)"},{"id":29,"start":38420.291,"end":39726.611000000004,"title":"Chapter 29 (Track 30)"},{"id":30,"start":39726.611000000004,"end":39829.184,"title":"Chapter 30 (Track 31)"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0dln2j","ino":"5952055763272391118","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Song of Albion 03","subtitle":"The Endless Knot","author":"Stephen R.

Fires rage in Albion: strange, hidden fires, dark-flamed, invisible to the eye. Llew Silver Hand is High King of Albion, but now the Brazen Man has defied his sovereignty and Llew must journey to the Foul Land to redeem his greatest treasure. The last battle begins, and the myths, passions, and heroism of an ancient people come to life as Llew faces his greatest test yet. The ancient Celts admitted no separation between this world and the Otherworld: The two were delicately interwoven, each dependent on the other.

novel about a teenage boy who must decide whether or not the world is worth saving. Henry Denton has spent years being periodically abducted by aliens. Then the aliens give him an ultimatum: The world will end in 144 days, and all Henry has to do to stop it is push a big red button. Only he isn't sure he wants to. After all, life hasn't been great for Henry. His mom is a struggling waitress held together by a thin layer of cigarette smoke. His brother is a jobless dropout who just knocked someone up. His grandmother is slowly losing herself to Alzheimer's. And Henry is still dealing with the grief of his boyfriend's suicide last year. Wiping the slate clean sounds like a pretty good choice to him. But Henry is a scientist first, and, facing the question thoroughly and logically, he begins to look for pros and cons: in the bully who is his perpetual one-night stand, in the best friend who betrayed him, in the brilliant and mysterious boy who walked into the wrong class. Weighing the pain and the joy that surrounds him, Henry is left with the ultimate choice: push the button and save the planet and everyone on it...or let the world - and his pain - be destroyed forever.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw0ecy5g/folder.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Shaun David Hutchinson/We Are the Ants/folder.jpg","genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1636964489459,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Shaun David Hutchinson/We Are the Ants","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Shaun David Hutchinson/We Are the Ants","addedAt":1636964435218,"lastUpdate":1636964489459,"duration":33243588,"size":539397910,"ebooks":[{"ino":"2266582009946281351","filetype":"ebook","filename":"Shaun David Hutchinson - We Are the Ants (retail) (epub).epub","ext":".epub","path":"Shaun David Hutchinson/We Are the Ants/Shaun David Hutchinson - We Are the Ants (retail) (epub).epub","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Shaun David Hutchinson/We Are the Ants/Shaun David Hutchinson - We Are the Ants (retail) (epub).epub","addedAt":1636964435218}],"numEbooks":1,"numTracks":9,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":3406.655,"title":"Shaun David Hutchinson - We Are the Ants [1-9]"},{"id":1,"start":3406.655,"end":7639.119000000001,"title":"Shaun David Hutchinson - We Are the Ants [2-9]"},{"id":2,"start":7639.119000000001,"end":11582.826000000001,"title":"Shaun David Hutchinson - We Are the Ants [3-9]"},{"id":3,"start":11582.826000000001,"end":14467.267,"title":"Shaun David Hutchinson - We Are the Ants [4-9]"},{"id":4,"start":14467.267,"end":18822.114999999998,"title":"Shaun David Hutchinson - We Are the Ants [5-9]"},{"id":5,"start":18822.114999999998,"end":21724.292999999998,"title":"Shaun David Hutchinson - We Are the Ants [6-9]"},{"id":6,"start":21724.292999999998,"end":26152.204999999998,"title":"Shaun David Hutchinson - We Are the Ants [7-9]"},{"id":7,"start":26152.204999999998,"end":29897.25,"title":"Shaun David Hutchinson - We Are the Ants [8-9]"},{"id":8,"start":29897.25,"end":33243.588,"title":"Shaun David Hutchinson - We Are the Ants [9-9]"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0ee42h","ino":"17525682303944039062","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"World Serpent Arcanist","subtitle":null,"author":"Shami Stovall","authorFL":"Shami Stovall","authorLF":"Stovall, Shami","narrator":"Brian Wiggins","series":"Frith Chronicles","volumeNumber":"5","publishYear":"2020","publisher":null,"description":"Death.

In Traitor's Blade, a disgraced swordsman struggles to redeem himself by protecting a young girl caught in the web of a royal conspiracy. The King is dead, the Greatcoats have been disbanded, and Falcio Val Mond and his fellow magistrates Kest and Brasti have been reduced to working as bodyguards for a nobleman who refuses to pay them. Things could be worse, of course. Their employer could be lying dead on the floor while they are forced to watch the killer plant evidence framing them for the murder. Oh wait, that's exactly what's happening. Now a royal conspiracy is about to unfold in the most corrupt city in the world. A carefully orchestrated series of murders that began with the overthrow of an idealistic young king will end with the death of an orphaned girl and the ruin of everything that Falcio, Kest, and Brasti have fought for. But if the trio want to foil the conspiracy, save the girl, and reunite the Greatcoats, they'll have to do it with nothing but the tattered coats on their backs and the swords in their hands, because these days every noble is a tyrant, every knight is a thug, and the only thing you can really trust is a traitor's blade.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw0enrv7/The Greatcoats 1 - Traitor's Blade.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Sebastien de Castell/Traitor's Blade/The Greatcoats 1 - Traitor's Blade.jpg","genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1636965030298,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Sebastien de Castell/Traitor's Blade","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Sebastien de Castell/Traitor's Blade","addedAt":1636964940351,"lastUpdate":1636965030298,"duration":46304042,"size":376567488,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":30,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":1181.71,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 01-30"},{"id":1,"start":1181.71,"end":2443.297,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 02-30"},{"id":2,"start":2443.297,"end":3527.855,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 03-30"},{"id":3,"start":3527.855,"end":5753.07,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 04-30"},{"id":4,"start":5753.07,"end":6893.635,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 05-30"},{"id":5,"start":6893.635,"end":8764.885,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 06-30"},{"id":6,"start":8764.885,"end":9394.518,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 07-30"},{"id":7,"start":9394.518,"end":10603.814,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 08-30"},{"id":8,"start":10603.814,"end":12982.467,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 09-30"},{"id":9,"start":12982.467,"end":13526.650000000001,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 10-30"},{"id":10,"start":13526.650000000001,"end":16246.45,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 11-30"},{"id":11,"start":16246.45,"end":18555.350000000002,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 12-30"},{"id":12,"start":18555.350000000002,"end":20869.544,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 13-30"},{"id":13,"start":20869.544,"end":23032.530000000002,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 14-30"},{"id":14,"start":23032.530000000002,"end":24147.553000000004,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 15-30"},{"id":15,"start":24147.553000000004,"end":26337.753000000004,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 16-30"},{"id":16,"start":26337.753000000004,"end":27522.436000000005,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 17-30"},{"id":17,"start":27522.436000000005,"end":28624.270000000004,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 18-30"},{"id":18,"start":28624.270000000004,"end":30215.023000000005,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 19-30"},{"id":19,"start":30215.023000000005,"end":31101.190000000006,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 20-30"},{"id":20,"start":31101.190000000006,"end":31989.493000000006,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 21-30"},{"id":21,"start":31989.493000000006,"end":33210.02700000001,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 22-30"},{"id":22,"start":33210.02700000001,"end":34842.57600000001,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 23-30"},{"id":23,"start":34842.57600000001,"end":35740.81700000001,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 24-30"},{"id":24,"start":35740.81700000001,"end":38253.86700000001,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 25-30"},{"id":25,"start":38253.86700000001,"end":40067.81000000001,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 26-30"},{"id":26,"start":40067.81000000001,"end":41563.54700000001,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 27-30"},{"id":27,"start":41563.54700000001,"end":43100.15100000001,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 28-30"},{"id":28,"start":43100.15100000001,"end":43729.877000000015,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 29-30"},{"id":29,"start":43729.877000000015,"end":46304.042000000016,"title":"Sebastien de Castell - Traitor's Blade 30-30"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0ept8u","ino":"4602701714986902944","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Soulbinder","subtitle":null,"author":"Sebastien de Castell","authorFL":"Sebastien de Castell","authorLF":"de Castell, Sebastien","narrator":"Joe Jameson","series":"Spellslinger","volumeNumber":"4","publishYear":"2018","publisher":null,"description":"A failed mage learns that just because he's not the chosen one it doesn't mean he can't be a hero in the fourth book of an exciting adventure fantasy series from Sebastien de Castell.

R. Martin), acclaimed author Scott Lynch continues to astound and entertain with his thrillingly inventive, wickedly funny, suspense-filled adventures featuring con artist extraordinaire Locke Lamora. And The Republic of Thieves is his most captivating novel yet. NAMED ONE OF PASTE’S BEST FANTASY BOOKS OF THE DECADE With what should have been the greatest heist of their career gone spectacularly sour, Locke and his trusted partner, Jean, have barely escaped with their lives. Or at least Jean has. But Locke is slowly succumbing to a deadly poison that no alchemist or physiker can cure. Yet just as the end is near, a mysterious Bondsmage offers Locke an opportunity that will either save him or finish him off once and for all. Magi political elections are imminent, and the factions are in need of a pawn. If Locke agrees to play the role, sorcery will be used to purge the venom from his body - though the process will be so excruciating he may well wish for death. Locke is opposed, but two factors cause his will to crumble: Jean's imploring - and the Bondsmage's mention of a woman from Locke’s past: Sabetha. She is the love of his life, his equal in skill and wit, and now, his greatest rival. Locke was smitten with Sabetha from his first glimpse of her as a young fellow orphan and thief-in-training. But after a tumultuous courtship, Sabetha broke away. Now they will reunite in yet another clash of wills. For faced with his one and only match in both love and trickery, Locke must choose whether to fight Sabetha - or to woo her. It is a decision on which both their lives may depend. Praise for The Republic of Thieves \"Fast paced, fun, and impossible to put down.... Locke and company remain among the most engaging protagonists in fantasy.” (Publishers Weekly, starred review) \"The Republic of Thieves has all the colorful action, witty repartee, and devious scheming that fans of the series have come to expect.\" (Wired) \"A fantasy world unique among its peers.... If you’re looking for a great new fantasy series this is one you won’t want to miss....

As Feyre navigates its dark web of politics, passion, and dazzling power, a greater evil looms - and she might be key to stopping it.

Everything has a spirit: the willow tree with leaves that kiss the pond, the stream that feeds the river, the wind that exhales fresh snow. But the spirits that reside within this land want to rid it of all humans. One woman stands between these malevolent spirits and the end of humankind: the queen. She alone has the magical power to prevent the spirits from destroying every man, woman, and child. But queens are still just human, and no matter how strong or good they are, the threat of danger always looms. With the position so precarious, young women are chosen to train as heirs. Daleina, a seemingly quiet academy student, is under no illusions as to her claim to the throne but simply wants to right the wrongs that have befallen the land. Ven, a disgraced champion, has spent his exile secretly fighting against the growing number of spirit attacks. Joining forces, these daring partners embark on a treacherous quest to find the source of the spirits' restlessness - a journey that will test their courage and trust and force them to stand against both enemies and friends to save their land before it's bathed in blood.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0fszgn/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Action & Adventure"],"lastUpdate":1636967016166,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Sarah Beth Durst/The Queen of Blood","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Sarah Beth Durst/The Queen of Blood","addedAt":1636966862591,"lastUpdate":1636967016166,"duration":48712440,"size":374532831,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":31,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":2134.56975,"title":"c2sr-001"},{"id":1,"start":2134.56975,"end":3765.1331250000003,"title":"c2sr-002"},{"id":2,"start":3765.1331250000003,"end":5249.6720000000005,"title":"c2sr-003"},{"id":3,"start":5249.6720000000005,"end":7540.193000000001,"title":"c2sr-004"},{"id":4,"start":7540.193000000001,"end":8607.608500000002,"title":"c2sr-005"},{"id":5,"start":8607.608500000002,"end":9878.047750000002,"title":"c2sr-006"},{"id":6,"start":9878.047750000002,"end":11372.957250000001,"title":"c2sr-007"},{"id":7,"start":11372.957250000001,"end":11878.661750000001,"title":"c2sr-008"},{"id":8,"start":11878.661750000001,"end":14286.890500000001,"title":"c2sr-009"},{"id":9,"start":14286.890500000001,"end":15379.5665,"title":"c2sr-010"},{"id":10,"start":15379.5665,"end":15925.813063000001,"title":"c2sr-011"},{"id":11,"start":15925.813063000001,"end":18492.500563,"title":"c2sr-012"},{"id":12,"start":18492.500563,"end":19729.529188,"title":"c2sr-013"},{"id":13,"start":19729.529188,"end":21826.691688,"title":"c2sr-014"},{"id":14,"start":21826.691688,"end":22879.452563,"title":"c2sr-015"},{"id":15,"start":22879.452563,"end":24255.583188,"title":"c2sr-016"},{"id":16,"start":24255.583188,"end":25604.415938000002,"title":"c2sr-017"},{"id":17,"start":25604.415938000002,"end":28558.499188,"title":"c2sr-018"},{"id":18,"start":28558.499188,"end":30477.428188,"title":"c2sr-019"},{"id":19,"start":30477.428188,"end":32190.590688,"title":"c2sr-020"},{"id":20,"start":32190.590688,"end":33369.026688,"title":"c2sr-021"},{"id":21,"start":33369.026688,"end":34508.723063,"title":"c2sr-022"},{"id":22,"start":34508.723063,"end":35718.427563,"title":"c2sr-023"},{"id":23,"start":35718.427563,"end":38483.462813,"title":"c2sr-024"},{"id":24,"start":38483.462813,"end":40706.692313,"title":"c2sr-025"},{"id":25,"start":40706.692313,"end":42727.551188,"title":"c2sr-026"},{"id":26,"start":42727.551188,"end":44206.160187999994,"title":"c2sr-027"},{"id":27,"start":44206.160187999994,"end":45604.86068799999,"title":"c2sr-028"},{"id":28,"start":45604.86068799999,"end":47642.333437999994,"title":"c2sr-029"},{"id":29,"start":47642.333437999994,"end":48042.21590699999,"title":"c2sr-030"},{"id":30,"start":48042.21590699999,"end":48712.43959499999,"title":"c2sr-031"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0g2471","ino":"2489604854155969211","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Conversations with Friends","subtitle":null,"author":"Sally Rooney","authorFL":"Sally Rooney","authorLF":"Rooney, Sally","narrator":"Aoife McMahon","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2017","publisher":null,"description":"A sharply intelligent novel about friendship, lust, jealousy, and the unexpected complications of adulthood in the 21st century Frances is a cool-headed and darkly observant young woman vaguely pursuing a career in writing while studying in Dublin. Her best friend and comrade-in-arms is the beautiful and endlessly self-possessed Bobbi. At a local poetry performance one night, Frances and Bobbi catch the eye of Melissa, a well-known photographer, and as the girls are then gradually drawn into Melissa's world, Frances is reluctantly impressed by the older woman's sophisticated home and tall, handsome husband, Nick. However amusing and ironic Frances and Nick's flirtation seems at first, it gives way to a strange intimacy, and Frances' friendship with Bobbi begins to fracture. As Frances tries to keep her life in check, her relationships increasingly resist her control: with Nick, with her difficult and unhappy father, and finally, terribly, with Bobbi. Desperate to reconcile her inner life to the desires and vulnerabilities of her body, Frances' intellectual certainties begin to yield to something new: a painful and disorienting way of living from moment to moment. Written with gemlike precision and marked by a sly sense of humor, Conversations with Friends is wonderfully alive to the pleasures and dangers of youth and the messy edges of female friendship.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0g2471/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre

A hopeful Millennial journey shines through McMahon's performance.\" (AudioFile Magazine, Earphones Award Winner) Beautiful World, Where Are You is a new novel by Sally Rooney, the bestselling author of Normal People and Conversations with Friends. Alice, a novelist, meets Felix, who works in a warehouse, and asks him if he’d like to travel to Rome with her. In Dublin, her best friend, Eileen, is getting over a break-up, and slips back into flirting with Simon, a man she has known since childhood. Alice, Felix, Eileen, and Simon are still young - but life is catching up with them. They desire each other, they delude each other, they get together, they break apart. They have sex, they worry about sex, they worry about their friendships and the world they live in. Are they standing in the last lighted room before the darkness, bearing witness to something? Will they find a way to believe in a beautiful world?

Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire has quite captured both palace intrigue and the way that tribal infighting and war hurt the vulnerable the most.\" (Paste Magazine) The final chapter in the best-selling, critically acclaimed Daevabad Trilogy, in which a con-woman and an idealistic djinn prince join forces to save a magical kingdom from a devastating civil war. Daevabad has fallen. After a brutal conquest stripped the city of its magic, Nahid leader Banu Manizheh and her resurrected commander, Dara, must try to repair their fraying alliance and stabilize a fractious, warring people.  But the bloodletting and loss of his beloved Nahri have unleashed the worst demons of Dara's dark past. To vanquish them, he must face some ugly truths about his history and put himself at the mercy of those he once considered enemies. Having narrowly escaped their murderous families and Daevabad's deadly politics, Nahri and Ali, now safe in Cairo, face difficult choices of their own. While Nahri finds peace in the old rhythms and familiar comforts of her human home, she is haunted by the knowledge that the loved ones she left behind and the people who considered her a savior are at the mercy of a new tyrant. Ali, too, cannot help but look back, and is determined to return to rescue his city and the family that remains. Seeking support in his mother’s homeland, he discovers that his connection to the marid goes far deeper than expected and threatens not only his relationship with Nahri, but his very faith.  As peace grows more elusive and old players return, Nahri, Ali, and Dara come to understand that in order to remake the world, they may need to fight those they once loved...and take a stand for those they once hurt.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0gw37f/cover.png","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Historical Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1636968878188,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"S.A.

A watershed moment in modern fantasy, this novel - and those that followed - broke exciting new ground in a beloved genre. Together with George R. R. Martin, Robin Hobb helped pave the way for such talented new voices as Scott Lynch, Brandon Sanderson, and Naomi Novik. Over the years, Hobb’s imagination has soared throughout the mythic lands of the Six Duchies in such best-selling series as the Liveship Traders Trilogy and the Rain Wilds Chronicles. But no matter how far she roamed, her heart always remained with Fitz. And now, at last, she has come home, with an astonishing new novel that opens a dark and gripping chapter in the Farseer saga. FitzChivalry - royal bastard and former king’s assassin - has left his life of intrigue behind. As far as the rest of the world knows, FitzChivalry Farseer is dead and buried. Masquerading as Tom Badgerlock, Fitz is now married to his childhood sweetheart, Molly, and leading the quiet life of a country squire. Though Fitz is haunted by the disappearance of the Fool, who did so much to shape Fitz into the man he has become, such private hurts are put aside in the business of daily life, at least until the appearance of menacing, pale-skinned strangers casts a sinister shadow over Fitz’s past...and his future. Now, to protect his new life, the former assassin must once again take up his old one....","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0jd1d3/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Action & Adventure"],"lastUpdate":1637003572286,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Robin Hobb/Fitz and the Fool 01 - Fool's Assassin","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Robin Hobb/Fitz and the Fool 01 - Fool's Assassin","addedAt":1636972836787,"lastUpdate":1637003572286,"duration":98311635,"size":784387637,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":34,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":664.0,"title":"Chapter 0 (Prologue)"},{"id":1,"start":664.0,"end":3967.0,"title":"Chapter 1 (Chapter 1)"},{"id":2,"start":3967.0,"end":6981.0,"title":"Chapter 2 (Chapter 2)"},{"id":3,"start":6981.0,"end":12254.0,"title":"Chapter 3 (Chapter 3)"},{"id":4,"start":12254.0,"end":15250.0,"title":"Chapter 4 (Chapter 4)"},{"id":5,"start":15250.0,"end":20907.96,"title":"Chapter 5 (Chapter 5)"},{"id":6,"start":20907.96,"end":22599.96,"title":"Chapter 6 (Chapter 6)"},{"id":7,"start":22599.96,"end":28597.96,"title":"Chapter 7 (Chapter 7)"},{"id":8,"start":28597.96,"end":31468.96,"title":"Chapter 8 (Chapter 8)"},{"id":9,"start":31468.96,"end":33344.96,"title":"Chapter 9 (Chapter 9)"},{"id":10,"start":33344.96,"end":35939.96,"title":"Chapter 10 (Chapter 10)"},{"id":11,"start":35939.96,"end":43677.96,"title":"Chapter 11 (Chapter 11)"},{"id":12,"start":43677.96,"end":44747.96,"title":"Chapter 12 (Chapter 12)"},{"id":13,"start":44747.96,"end":49108.96,"title":"Chapter 13 (Chapter 13)"},{"id":14,"start":49108.96,"end":52911.96,"title":"Chapter 14 (Chapter 14)"},{"id":15,"start":52911.96,"end":56692.96,"title":"Chapter 15 (Chapter 15)"},{"id":16,"start":56692.96,"end":60159.96,"title":"Chapter 16 (Chapter 16)"},{"id":17,"start":60159.96,"end":62548.96,"title":"Chapter 17 (Chapter 17)"},{"id":18,"start":62548.96,"end":63443.96,"title":"Chapter 18 (Chapter 18)"},{"id":19,"start":63443.96,"end":65376.96,"title":"Chapter 19 (Chapter 19)"},{"id":20,"start":65376.96,"end":66796.95999999999,"title":"Chapter 20 (Chapter 20)"},{"id":21,"start":66796.95999999999,"end":68797.95999999999,"title":"Chapter 21 (Chapter 21)"},{"id":22,"start":68797.95999999999,"end":70198.95999999999,"title":"Chapter 22 (Chapter 22)"},{"id":23,"start":70198.95999999999,"end":70902.94299299999,"title":"Chapter 23 (Chapter 23)"},{"id":24,"start":70902.94299299999,"end":73544.94299299999,"title":"Chapter 24 (Chapter 24)"},{"id":25,"start":73544.94299299999,"end":76209.94299299999,"title":"Chapter 25 (Chapter 25)"},{"id":26,"start":76209.94299299999,"end":81514.94299299999,"title":"Chapter 26 (Chapter 26)"},{"id":27,"start":81514.94299299999,"end":84122.94299299999,"title":"Chapter 27 (Chapter 27)"},{"id":28,"start":84122.94299299999,"end":85588.94299299999,"title":"Chapter 28 (Chapter 28)"},{"id":29,"start":85588.94299299999,"end":86556.94299299999,"title":"Chapter 29 (Chapter 29)"},{"id":30,"start":86556.94299299999,"end":89319.94299299999,"title":"Chapter 30 (Chapter 30)"},{"id":31,"start":89319.94299299999,"end":93786.94299299999,"title":"Chapter 31 (Chapter 31)"},{"id":32,"start":93786.94299299999,"end":97930.94299299999,"title":"Chapter 32 (Chapter 32)"},{"id":33,"start":97930.94299299999,"end":98293.94299299999,"title":"Chapter 33 (Epilogue)"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0jr9pe","ino":"5779527989491170662","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Royal Assassin","subtitle":null,"author":"Robin Hobb","authorFL":"Robin Hobb","authorLF":"Hobb, Robin","narrator":"Paul Boehmer","series":"Farseer Trilogy","volumeNumber":"2","publishYear":"1996","publisher":null,"description":"Young Fitz, the illegitimate son of the noble Prince Chivalry, is ignored by all royalty except the devious King Shrewd, who has had him tutored him in the dark arts of the assassin.

Now in development for TV! Since its debut in 1990, The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan has captivated millions of readers and listeners around the globe with its scope, originality, and compelling characters. The Wheel of Time turns and ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow. Tarmon Gai'don, the Last Battle, looms. And mankind is not ready. The final volume of the Wheel of Time, A Memory of Light, was partially written by Robert Jordan before his untimely passing in 2007. Brandon Sanderson, New York Times best-selling author of the Mistborn books, and now Stormlight Archive, among others, was chosen by Jordan's editor - his wife, Harriet McDougal - to complete the final volume, later expanded to three books. In this epic novel, Robert Jordan's international best-selling series begins its dramatic conclusion.   Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, struggles to unite a fractured network of kingdoms and alliances in preparation for the Last Battle. As he attempts to halt the Seanchan encroachment northward - wishing he could form at least a temporary truce with the invaders - his allies watch in terror the shadow that seems to be growing within the heart of the Dragon Reborn himself. Egwene al'Vere, the Amyrlin Seat of the rebel Aes Sedai, is a captive of the White Tower and subject to the whims of their tyrannical leader. As days tick toward the Seanchan attack she knows is imminent, Egwene works to hold together the disparate factions of Aes Sedai while providing leadership in the face of increasing uncertainty and despair. Her fight will prove the mettle of the Aes Sedai, and her conflict will decide the future of the White Tower - and possibly the world itself.  TV series update: \"Sony will produce along with Red Eagle Entertainment and Radar Pictures. Rafe Judkins is attached to write and executive produce. Judkins previously worked on shows such as ABC’s Agents of SHIELD, the Netflix series Hemlock Grove, and the NBC series Chuck. Red Eagle partners Rick Selvage and Larry Mondragon will executive produce along with Radar’s Ted Field and Mike Weber. Darren Lemke will also executive produce, with Jordan’s widow Harriet McDougal serving as consulting producer.\" (Variety) The Wheel of Time New Spring: The Novel The Eye of the World The Great Hunt The Dragon Reborn The Shadow Rising The Fires of Heaven Lord of Chaos A Crown of Swords The Path of Daggers Winter's Heart Crossroads of Twilight Knife of Dreams by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson The Gathering Storm Towers of Midnight A Memory of Light by Robert Jordan   Warrior of the Altaii by Robert Jordan and Teresa Patterson   The World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan, Harriet McDougal, Alan Romanczuk, and Maria Simons  The Wheel of Time Companion by Robert Jordan and Amy Romanczuk  Patterns of the Wheel: Coloring Art Based on Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0kxx63/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1636995542232,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Robert Jordan/The Gathering Storm","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Robert Jordan/The Gathering Storm","addedAt":1636975491389,"lastUpdate":1636995542232,"duration":118153689,"size":1917131459,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":47,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":2600.725,"title":"Robert Jordan -

The Wheel of Time turns and ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow. Fleeing from Ebou Dar with the kidnapped Daughter of the Nine Moons, whom he is fated to marry, Mat Cauthon learns that he can neither keep her nor let her go, not in safety for either of them, for both the Shadow and the might of the Seanchan Empire are in deadly pursuit.  Perrin Aybara seeks to free his wife, Faile, a captive of the Shaido, but his only hope may be an alliance with the enemy. Can he remain true to his friend Rand and to himself? For his love of Faile, Perrin is willing to sell his soul.  At Tar Valon, Egwene al'Vere, the young Amyrlin of the rebel Aes Sedai, lays siege to the heart of Aes Sedai power, but she must win quickly, with as little bloodshed as possible, for unless the Aes Sedai are reunited, only the male Asha'man will remain to defend the world against the Dark One, and nothing can hold the Asha'man themselves back from total power except the Aes Sedai and a unified White Tower. In Andor, Elayne Trakland fights for the Lion Throne that is hers by right, but enemies and Darkfriends surround her, plotting her destruction. If she fails, Andor may fall to the Shadow, and the Dragon Reborn with it.Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn himself, has cleansed the Dark One's taint from the male half of the True Source, and everything has changed. Yet nothing has, for only men who can channel believe that saidin is clean again, and a man who can channel is still hated and feared-even one prophesied to save the world.  Now, Rand must gamble again, with himself at stake, and he cannot be sure which of his allies are really enemies.

Orso Igancio and his star employee, former thief Sancia Grado, are accomplishing brilliant things with scriving, the magical art of encoding sentience into everyday objects, but it's not enough. The massive merchant houses of Tevanne won't tolerate competition, and they're willing to do anything to crush Foundryside. But even the merchant houses of Tevanne might have met their match. An immensely powerful and deadly entity has been resurrected in the shadows of Tevanne, one that's not interested in wealth or trade routes: a hierophant, one of the ancient practitioners of scriving. And he has a great fascination for Foundryside and its employees - especially Sancia.  Now Sancia and the rest of Foundryside must race to combat this new menace, which means understanding the origins of scriving itself - before the hierophant burns Tevanne to the ground.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0mb4if/cover.png","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction &

adventure, courage, and survival. Fiver could sense danger. Something terrible was going to happen to the warren; he felt sure of it. They had to leave immediately. So begins a long and perilous journey of survival for a small band of rabbits. As the rabbits skirt danger at every turn, we become acquainted with the band, its humorous characters, and its compelling culture, complete with its own folk history and mythos. Fiver’s vision finally leads them to Watership Down, an upland meadow. But here they face their most difficult challenges of all. A stirring epic of courage and survival against the odds, Watership Down has become a beloved classic for all ages. Both an exciting adventure story and an involving allegory about freedom, ethics, and human nature, it has delighted generations with its unique and charming world, winning many awards and being adapted to film, television, and theater.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0n1big/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature &

in the Between Earth and Sky trilogy, inspired by the civilizations of the Pre-Columbian Americas and woven into a tale of celestial prophecies, political intrigue, and forbidden magic. A god will return When the earth and sky converge Under the black sun In the holy city of Tova, the winter solstice is usually a time for celebration and renewal, but this year it coincides with a solar eclipse, a rare celestial event proscribed by the Sun Priest as an unbalancing of the world. Meanwhile, a ship launches from a distant city bound for Tova and set to arrive on the solstice. The captain of the ship, Xiala, is a disgraced Teek whose song can calm the waters around her as easily as it can warp a man’s mind. Her ship carries one passenger. Described as harmless, the passenger, Serapio, is a young man, blind, scarred, and cloaked in destiny. As Xiala well knows, when a man is described as harmless, he usually ends up being a villain. Crafted with unforgettable characters, Rebecca Roanhorse has created an epic adventure exploring the decadence of power amid the weight of history and the struggle of individuals swimming against the confines of society and their broken pasts in the most original series debut of the decade.      PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw0o2ib2/Rebecca Roanhorse -

Nebula and Hugo Award Finalist  Named one of Paste's Best Fantasy Books of the Decade Named one of the top 10 books of the year by The New York Public Library and one of the best books of the year by: The New York Times Book Review; NPR; Time; Tor.com; PopSugar; Vox; Vulture; Paste; Bustle; Library Journal With the Nebula Award-winning Uprooted, Naomi Novik opened a brilliant new chapter in an already acclaimed career, delving into the magic of fairy tales to craft a love story that was both timeless and utterly of the now. Spinning Silver draws listeners deeper into this glittering realm of fantasy, where the boundary between wonder and terror is thinner than a breath, and safety can be stolen as quickly as a kiss.  Miryem is the daughter and granddaughter of moneylenders, but her father’s inability to collect his debts has left his family on the edge of poverty - until Miryem takes matters into her own hands. Hardening her heart, the young woman sets out to claim what is owed and soon gains a reputation for being able to turn silver into gold. When an ill-advised boast draws the attention of the king of the Staryk - grim fey creatures who seem more ice than flesh - Miryem’s fate, and that of two kingdoms, will be forever altered.  She will face an impossible challenge and, along with two unlikely allies, uncover a secret that threatens to consume the lands of humans and Staryk alike.  Praise for Spinning Silver: '“A perfect tale.... A big and meaty novel, rich in both ideas and people, with the vastness of Tolkien and the empathy and joy in daily life of Le Guin.” (The New York Times Book Review) “Gorgeous, complex, and magical.... This is the kind of book that one might wish to inhabit forever.” (Publishers Weekly) “Cool and clever and . . . dire and wonderful.” (Laini Taylor, author of Strange the Dreamer) “The Rumpelstiltskin fairy tale has never been as captivating....

But the city decays, poisonous disorder is rife, and whispered prophecy foretells of cataclysm and doom.

With Age of Myth, Age of Swords, and the New York Times best-selling Age of War, fantasy master Michael J. Sullivan riveted fans with a tale of unlikely heroes locked in a desperate battle to save humankind. After years of warfare, humanity has gained the upper hand and has pushed the Fhrey to the edge of their homeland, but no farther. Now comes the pivotal moment. Persephone’s plan to use the stalemate to seek peace is destroyed by an unexpected betrayal that threatens to hand victory to her enemy and leaves a loved one in peril. Humanity’s only hope lies in the legend of a witch, a forgotten song, and a simple garden door.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0wxnnm/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Action & Adventure"],"lastUpdate":1637002852574,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Michael J Sullivan/Age of Legend","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Michael J Sullivan/Age of Legend","addedAt":1636995633754,"lastUpdate":1637002852574,"duration":52455826,"size":641489958,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":33,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":2005.865,"title":"001 - Chapter 01"},{"id":1,"start":2005.865,"end":4609.438,"title":"002 - Chapter 02"},{"id":2,"start":4609.438,"end":5352.5960000000005,"title":"003 - Chapter 03"},{"id":3,"start":5352.5960000000005,"end":8372.116,"title":"004 - Chapter 04"},{"id":4,"start":8372.116,"end":9886.383,"title":"005 - Chapter 05"},{"id":5,"start":9886.383,"end":12110.71,"title":"006 - Chapter 06"},{"id":6,"start":12110.71,"end":13506.982,"title":"007 - Chapter 07"},{"id":7,"start":13506.982,"end":14976.631,"title":"008 - Chapter 08"},{"id":8,"start":14976.631,"end":17072.618,"title":"009 - Chapter 09"},{"id":9,"start":17072.618,"end":18822.430999999997,"title":"010 - Chapter 10"},{"id":10,"start":18822.430999999997,"end":19907.792999999998,"title":"011 - Chapter 11"},{"id":11,"start":19907.792999999998,"end":22192.228,"title":"012 - Chapter 12"},{"id":12,"start":22192.228,"end":23090.083,"title":"013 - Chapter 13"},{"id":13,"start":23090.083,"end":23821.016,"title":"014 - Chapter 14"},{"id":14,"start":23821.016,"end":24792.432,"title":"015 - Chapter 15"},{"id":15,"start":24792.432,"end":25860.945,"title":"016 - Chapter 16"},{"id":16,"start":25860.945,"end":26511.159,"title":"017 - Chapter 17"},{"id":17,"start":26511.159,"end":27988.933,"title":"018 - Chapter 18"},{"id":18,"start":27988.933,"end":30040.46,"title":"019 - Chapter 19"},{"id":19,"start":30040.46,"end":32093.424,"title":"020 - Chapter 20"},{"id":20,"start":32093.424,"end":34137.898,"title":"021 - Chapter 21"},{"id":21,"start":34137.898,"end":35473.33,"title":"022 - Chapter 22"},{"id":22,"start":35473.33,"end":37592.749,"title":"023 - Chapter 23"},{"id":23,"start":37592.749,"end":38316.054000000004,"title":"024 - Chapter 24"},{"id":24,"start":38316.054000000004,"end":39674.317,"title":"025 - Chapter 25"},{"id":25,"start":39674.317,"end":40452.427,"title":"026 - Chapter 26"},{"id":26,"start":40452.427,"end":43321.43,"title":"027 - Chapter 27"},{"id":27,"start":43321.43,"end":45371.259,"title":"028 - Chapter 28"},{"id":28,"start":45371.259,"end":46728.059,"title":"029 - Chapter 29"},{"id":29,"start":46728.059,"end":50203.86,"title":"030 - Chapter 30"},{"id":30,"start":50203.86,"end":50981.317,"title":"031 - Chapter 31"},{"id":31,"start":50981.317,"end":52422.859000000004,"title":"032 - Chapter 32"},{"id":32,"start":52422.859000000004,"end":52455.826,"title":"033 - Chapter 33"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0x88zy","ino":"3506986823892574535","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"To Light A Candle","subtitle":null,"author":"Mercedes Lackey, James Mallory","authorFL":"Mercedes Lackey, James Mallory","authorLF":"Lackey, Mercedes, Mallory, James","narrator":"Susan Ericksen","series":"Obsidian Trilogy","volumeNumber":"2","publishYear":"2004","publisher":null,"description":"To his own surprise, young Kellen, once the disappointing son of the great Mage who leads the City’s Mage Council, has become a powerful Knight-Mage.

A shadow has fallen over the Tressian Republic. Ruling families - once protectors of justice and democracy - now plot against one another with sharp words and sharper knives. Blinded by ambition, they remain heedless of the threat posed by the invading armies of the Hadari Empire.  Yet as Tressia falls, heroes rise. Viktor Akadra is the Republic's champion. A warrior without equal, he hides a secret that would see him burned as a heretic.  Josiri Trelan is Viktor's sworn enemy. A political prisoner, he dreams of reigniting his mother's failed rebellion.  And yet Calenne Trelan, Josiri's sister, seeks only to break free of their tarnished legacy; to escape the expectation and prejudice that haunts the family name.  As war spreads across the Republic, these three must set aside their differences in order to save their home. Yet decades of bad blood are not easily set aside. And victory - if it comes at all - will demand a darker price than any of them could have imagined.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0z0veb/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction &

it: Caine, a street thug turned superstar, battling in a future where reality shows take place in another dimension, on a world where magic exists and gods are up close and personal. In that beautiful, savage land, Caine is an assassin without peer, a living legend born from one of the highest-rated reality shows ever made. That season, Caine almost single-handedly defeated – and all but exterminated – the fiercest of all tribes: the Black Knives. But the shocking truth of what really took place during that blood-drenched adventure has never been revealed....until now. Thirty years later, Caine returns to the scene of his greatest triumph – some would say greatest crime – at the request of his adopted brother, Orbek, the last of the true Black Knives. But where Caine goes, danger follows, and he soon finds himself back in familiar territory: fighting for his life against impossible odds, with the fate of two worlds hanging in the balance. Just the way Caine likes it.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw0zpoie/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637000302042,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Matthew Stover/Caine Black Knife","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Matthew Stover/Caine Black Knife","addedAt":1637000300524,"lastUpdate":1637000302043,"duration":50115211,"size":398007635,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":1,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":1063.379,"title":"001"},{"id":1,"start":1063.379,"end":1983.588,"title":"002"},{"id":2,"start":1983.588,"end":5484.601,"title":"003"},{"id":3,"start":5484.601,"end":7470.701,"title":"004"},{"id":4,"start":7470.701,"end":10384.481,"title":"005"},{"id":5,"start":10384.481,"end":12098.011,"title":"006"},{"id":6,"start":12098.011,"end":15198.209,"title":"007"},{"id":7,"start":15198.209,"end":16810.089,"title":"008"},{"id":8,"start":16810.089,"end":20274.878,"title":"009"},{"id":9,"start":20274.878,"end":23230.546,"title":"010"},{"id":10,"start":23230.546,"end":25450.141,"title":"011"},{"id":11,"start":25450.141,"end":26441.076,"title":"012"},{"id":12,"start":26441.076,"end":28880.428,"title":"013"},{"id":13,"start":28880.428,"end":31347.919,"title":"014"},{"id":14,"start":31347.919,"end":33982.221,"title":"015"},{"id":15,"start":33982.221,"end":36429.089,"title":"016"},{"id":16,"start":36429.089,"end":40390.975,"title":"017"},{"id":17,"start":40390.975,"end":42812.165,"title":"018"},{"id":18,"start":42812.165,"end":48090.758,"title":"019"},{"id":19,"start":48090.758,"end":50115.211,"title":"020"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw0zpph7","ino":"4355904909426382933","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Blade of Tyshalle","subtitle":null,"author":"Matthew Stover","authorFL":"Matthew Stover","authorLF":"Stover, Matthew","narrator":"Stefan Rudnicki","series":"Acts of Caine","volumeNumber":"2","publishYear":"2001","publisher":null,"description":"On Earth, Hari Michaelson was a superstar.

Choi comes a funny and emotional story about two estranged sisters and how far they’ll go to save one of their lives - even if it means swapping identities. Jayne and June Baek are nothing alike. June’s three years older, a classic first-born, know-it-all narc with a problematic finance job and an equally soulless apartment (according to Jayne). Jayne is an emotionally stunted, self-obsessed basket case who lives in squalor, has egregious taste in men, and needs to get to class and stop wasting Mom and Dad’s money (if you ask June). Once thick as thieves, these sisters who moved from Seoul to San Antonio to New York together now don’t want anything to do with each other. That is, until June gets cancer. And Jayne becomes the only one who can help her. Flung together by circumstance, housing woes, and family secrets, will the sisters learn more about each other than they’re willing to confront? And what if while helping June, Jayne has to confront the fact that maybe she’s sick, too?","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw102wnr/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Teen","Literature & Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637000969149,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Mary H.K.

All the horrors of Hell stand between Snorri Ver Snagason and the rescue of his family, if indeed the dead can be rescued. For Jalan Kendeth, getting back out alive and with Loki's key is all that matters. Loki's creation can open any lock, any door, and it may also be the key to Jalan's fortune back in the living world. Jalan plans to return to the three w's that have been the core of his idle and debauched life: wine, women, and wagering. Fate, however, has other plans - larger plans. The Wheel of Osheim is turning ever faster, and it will crack the world unless it's stopped. When the end of all things looms and there's nowhere to run, even the worst coward must find new answers. Jalan and Snorri face many dangers, from the corpse hordes of the Dead King to the many mirrors of the Lady Blue, but in the end, fast or slow, the Wheel of Osheim always pulls you back. In the end it's win or die.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw10fqmx/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637001652514,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Mark Lawrence/The Wheel of Osheim","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Mark Lawrence/The Wheel of Osheim","addedAt":1637001516674,"lastUpdate":1637001652514,"duration":68356330,"size":836616575,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":37,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":13.024,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 01-37"},{"id":1,"start":13.024,"end":384.996,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 02-37"},{"id":2,"start":384.996,"end":931.501,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 03-37"},{"id":3,"start":931.501,"end":3694.5370000000003,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 04-37"},{"id":4,"start":3694.5370000000003,"end":5414.3460000000005,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 05-37"},{"id":5,"start":5414.3460000000005,"end":8164.983,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 06-37"},{"id":6,"start":8164.983,"end":11645.608,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 07-37"},{"id":7,"start":11645.608,"end":14050.36,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 08-37"},{"id":8,"start":14050.36,"end":16360.281,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 09-37"},{"id":9,"start":16360.281,"end":19644.837,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 10-37"},{"id":10,"start":19644.837,"end":21110.156,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 11-37"},{"id":11,"start":21110.156,"end":22434.716,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 12-37"},{"id":12,"start":22434.716,"end":24508.77,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 13-37"},{"id":13,"start":24508.77,"end":25975.39,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 14-37"},{"id":14,"start":25975.39,"end":27359.253,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 15-37"},{"id":15,"start":27359.253,"end":28498.099000000002,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 16-37"},{"id":16,"start":28498.099000000002,"end":30579.397,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 17-37"},{"id":17,"start":30579.397,"end":32136.528000000002,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 18-37"},{"id":18,"start":32136.528000000002,"end":33063.145000000004,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 19-37"},{"id":19,"start":33063.145000000004,"end":34966.764,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 20-37"},{"id":20,"start":34966.764,"end":36480.520000000004,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 21-37"},{"id":21,"start":36480.520000000004,"end":40105.129,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 22-37"},{"id":22,"start":40105.129,"end":41611.362,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 23-37"},{"id":23,"start":41611.362,"end":42814.714,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 24-37"},{"id":24,"start":42814.714,"end":45056.554000000004,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 25-37"},{"id":25,"start":45056.554000000004,"end":46826.008,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 26-37"},{"id":26,"start":46826.008,"end":49093.902,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 27-37"},{"id":27,"start":49093.902,"end":51785.374,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 28-37"},{"id":28,"start":51785.374,"end":54292.851,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 29-37"},{"id":29,"start":54292.851,"end":55191.138,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 30-37"},{"id":30,"start":55191.138,"end":58072.132,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 31-37"},{"id":31,"start":58072.132,"end":59612.684,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 32-37"},{"id":32,"start":59612.684,"end":63236.222,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 33-37"},{"id":33,"start":63236.222,"end":64768.879,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 34-37"},{"id":34,"start":64768.879,"end":67684.144,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 35-37"},{"id":35,"start":67684.144,"end":68324.211,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 36-37"},{"id":36,"start":68324.211,"end":68356.33,"title":"Mark Lawrence - The Wheel of Osheim 37-37"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw10in45","ino":"10370746281640756343","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"The Liar's Key","subtitle":null,"author":"Mark Lawrence","authorFL":"Mark Lawrence","authorLF":"Lawrence, Mark","narrator":"Tim Gerard Reynolds","series":"Red Queen's War","volumeNumber":"2","publishYear":"2015","publisher":null,"description":"Prince of Fools, The Red Queen's War: Book One had all \"the hallmarks of [Mark Lawrence's] storytelling and writing style which made The Broken Empire trilogy such an incredibly addictive read\" (Bibliosanctum.com).

Behind its walls, the Convent of Sweet Mercy has trained young girls to hone their skills for centuries. In Mystic Class, Novice Nona Grey has begun to learn the secrets of the universe. But so often even the deepest truths just make our choices harder. Before she leaves the convent, Nona must choose which order to dedicate herself to - and whether her path will lead to a life of prayer and service or one of the blade and the fist. All that stands between her and these choices are the pride of a thwarted assassin, the designs of a would-be empress wielding the Inquisition like a knife, and the vengeance of the empire's richest lord. As the world narrows around her, and her enemies attack her through the system she is sworn to, Nona must find her own path despite the competing pulls of friendship, revenge, ambition, and loyalty. And in all this only one thing is certain: there will be blood.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw11gcbf/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637003450694,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Mark Lawrence/Grey Sister","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Mark Lawrence/Grey Sister","addedAt":1637003224357,"lastUpdate":1637003450694,"duration":56839594,"size":456555877,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":51,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":16.0,"title":"Chapter 0 (Opening Credits)"},{"id":1,"start":16.0,"end":498.0,"title":"Chapter 1 (The Story so Far)"},{"id":2,"start":498.0,"end":911.0,"title":"Chapter 2 (Prologue)"},{"id":3,"start":911.0,"end":2517.0,"title":"Chapter 3 (Chapter 1)"},{"id":4,"start":2517.0,"end":3302.0,"title":"Chapter 4 (Chapter 2)"},{"id":5,"start":3302.0,"end":4338.0,"title":"Chapter 5 (Chapter 3)"},{"id":6,"start":4338.0,"end":5036.0,"title":"Chapter 6 (Chapter 4)"},{"id":7,"start":5036.0,"end":7006.0,"title":"Chapter 7 (Chapter 5)"},{"id":8,"start":7006.0,"end":8677.0,"title":"Chapter 8 (Chapter 6)"},{"id":9,"start":8677.0,"end":10336.0,"title":"Chapter 9 (Chapter 7)"},{"id":10,"start":10336.0,"end":12703.0,"title":"Chapter 10 (Chapter 8)"},{"id":11,"start":12703.0,"end":13614.0,"title":"Chapter 11 (Chapter 9)"},{"id":12,"start":13614.0,"end":14424.0,"title":"Chapter 12 (Chapter 10)"},{"id":13,"start":14424.0,"end":15229.0,"title":"Chapter 13 (Chapter 11)"},{"id":14,"start":15229.0,"end":17040.0,"title":"Chapter 14 (Chapter 12)"},{"id":15,"start":17040.0,"end":18527.0,"title":"Chapter 15 (Chapter 13)"},{"id":16,"start":18527.0,"end":18972.0,"title":"Chapter 16 (Chapter 14)"},{"id":17,"start":18972.0,"end":19499.0,"title":"Chapter 17 (Chapter 15)"},{"id":18,"start":19499.0,"end":21813.0,"title":"Chapter 18 (Chapter 16)"},{"id":19,"start":21813.0,"end":23215.0,"title":"Chapter 19 (Chapter 17)"},{"id":20,"start":23215.0,"end":23959.0,"title":"Chapter 20 (Chapter 18)"},{"id":21,"start":23959.0,"end":24802.0,"title":"Chapter 21 (Chapter 19)"},{"id":22,"start":24802.0,"end":25445.0,"title":"Chapter 22 (Chapter 20)"},{"id":23,"start":25445.0,"end":26633.0,"title":"Chapter 23 (Chapter 21)"},{"id":24,"start":26633.0,"end":27461.0,"title":"Chapter 24 (Chapter 22)"},{"id":25,"start":27461.0,"end":27990.0,"title":"Chapter 25 (Chapter 23)"},{"id":26,"start":27990.0,"end":29101.0,"title":"Chapter 26 (Chapter 24)"},{"id":27,"start":29101.0,"end":29930.973991,"title":"Chapter 27 (Chapter 25)"},{"id":28,"start":29930.973991,"end":30601.973991,"title":"Chapter 28 (Chapter 26)"},{"id":29,"start":30601.973991,"end":31950.973991,"title":"Chapter 29 (Chapter 27)"},{"id":30,"start":31950.973991,"end":32867.973991,"title":"Chapter 30 (Chapter 28)"},{"id":31,"start":32867.973991,"end":33683.973991,"title":"Chapter 31 (Chapter 29)"},{"id":32,"start":33683.973991,"end":34589.973991,"title":"Chapter 32 (Chapter 30)"},{"id":33,"start":34589.973991,"end":35796.973991,"title":"Chapter 33 (Chapter 31)"},{"id":34,"start":35796.973991,"end":37045.973991,"title":"Chapter 34 (Chapter 32)"},{"id":35,"start":37045.973991,"end":38815.973991,"title":"Chapter 35 (Chapter 33)"},{"id":36,"start":38815.973991,"end":39771.973991,"title":"Chapter 36 (Chapter 34)"},{"id":37,"start":39771.973991,"end":40601.973991,"title":"Chapter 37 (Chapter 35)"},{"id":38,"start":40601.973991,"end":41430.973991,"title":"Chapter 38 (Chapter 36)"},{"id":39,"start":41430.973991,"end":43531.973991,"title":"Chapter 39 (Chapter 37)"},{"id":40,"start":43531.973991,"end":46012.973991,"title":"Chapter 40 (Chapter 38)"},{"id":41,"start":46012.973991,"end":47632.973991,"title":"Chapter 41 (Chapter 39)"},{"id":42,"start":47632.973991,"end":48359.973991,"title":"Chapter 42 (Chapter 40)"},{"id":43,"start":48359.973991,"end":50230.973991,"title":"Chapter 43 (Chapter 41)"},{"id":44,"start":50230.973991,"end":52542.973991,"title":"Chapter 44 (Chapter 42)"},{"id":45,"start":52542.973991,"end":53162.973991,"title":"Chapter 45 (Chapter 43)"},{"id":46,"start":53162.973991,"end":53732.973991,"title":"Chapter 46 (Chapter 44)"},{"id":47,"start":53732.973991,"end":54850.973991,"title":"Chapter 47 (Chapter 45)"},{"id":48,"start":54850.973991,"end":55571.973991,"title":"Chapter 48 (Chapter 46)"},{"id":49,"start":55571.973991,"end":56532.973991,"title":"Chapter 49 (Chapter 47)"},{"id":50,"start":56532.973991,"end":56813.94,"title":"Chapter 50 (Epilogue)"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw11ts21","ino":"6856848697523918170","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"The Song of Achilles","subtitle":null,"author":"Madeline Miller","authorFL":"Madeline Miller","authorLF":"Miller, Madeline","narrator":"Frazer Douglas","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2012","publisher":null,"description":"The legend begins... Greece in the age of heroes. Patroclus, an awkward young prince, has been exiled to the kingdom of Phthia to be raised in the shadow of King Peleus and his golden son, Achilles. “The best of all the Greeks”—strong, beautiful, and the child of a goddess—Achilles is everything the shamed Patroclus is not. Yet despite their differences, the boys become steadfast companions. Their bond deepens as they grow into young men and become skilled in the arts of war and medicine—much to the displeasure and the fury of Achilles’ mother, Thetis, a cruel sea goddess with a hatred of mortals. When word comes that Helen of Sparta has been kidnapped, the men of Greece, bound by blood and oath, must lay siege to Troy in her name. Seduced by the promise of a glorious destiny, Achilles joins their cause, and torn between love and fear for his friend, Patroclus follows. Little do they know that the Fates will test them both as never before and demand a terrible sacrifice. Built on the groundwork of the Iliad, Madeline Miller’s page-turning, profoundly moving, and blisteringly paced retelling of the epic Trojan War marks the launch of a dazzling career.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw11ts21/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637004294801,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Madeline Miller/The Song of Achilles","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Madeline Miller/The Song of Achilles","addedAt":1637003851215,"lastUpdate":1637004294801,"duration":40504656,"size":661386248,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":45,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":913.633,"title":"Madeline Miller -

He just doesn't know it yet. Aram thinks he’s nothing but a misfit from a small fishing village in a dark corner of the world. As far as Aram knows, he has nothing, with hardly a possession to his name other than a desire to make friends and be accepted by those around him, which is something he’s never known. But Aram is more. Much, much more. Unknown to him, Aram bears within him a gift so old and rare that many people would kill him for it, and there are others who would twist him to use for their own sinister purposes. These magics are so potent that Aram earns a place at an academy for warrior mages training to earn for themselves the greatest place of honor among the armies of men: dragon riders. Aram will have to fight for respect by becoming not just a dragon rider, but a Champion, the caliber of mage that hasn’t existed in the world for hundreds of years. And the land needs a Champion. Because when a dark god out of ancient myth arises to threaten the world of magic, it is Aram the world will turn to in its hour of need.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw129e87/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction &

that kept her imprisoned in her family's castle of Valenda. Her newfound freedom is costly, bittersweet with memories, regrets, and guilty secrets, for she knows the truth of what brought her land to the brink of destruction. And now the road, escape, beckons...A simple pilgrimage, perhaps. Quite fitting for the Dowager Royina of Chalion. Yet something else is free, too, something beyond deadly. To the north lies the vital border fortress of Porifors. Memories linger there as well, of wars and invasions and the mighty Golden General of Jokona. And someone, something, watches from across that border: humans, demons, gods. Ista thinks her little party of pilgrims wanders at will, but whose? When Ista's retinue is unexpectedly set upon not long into its travels, a mysterious ally appears, a warrior nobleman who fights like a berserker. The temporary safety of her enigmatic champion's castle cannot ease Ista's mounting dread, however, when she finds his dark secrets are entangled with hers in a net of the gods' own weaving. In her dreams, the threads are already drawing her to unforseen chances, fateful meetings, fearsome choices. What the inscrutable gods commanded of her in the past brought her land to the brink of devastation. Now, once again, they have chosen Ista as their instrument. And again, for good or for ill, she must comply.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw12i9ge/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Romance","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637005102698,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Lois McMaster Bujold/Paladin of Souls","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Lois McMaster Bujold/Paladin of Souls","addedAt":1637004993654,"lastUpdate":1637005102698,"duration":53327418,"size":432922675,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":15,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":3695.099,"title":"Lois McMaster Bujold - Paladin of Souls 01-15"},{"id":1,"start":3695.099,"end":6178.639,"title":"Lois McMaster Bujold - Paladin of Souls 02-15"},{"id":2,"start":6178.639,"end":10119.968,"title":"Lois McMaster Bujold - Paladin of Souls 03-15"},{"id":3,"start":10119.968,"end":14127.596000000001,"title":"Lois McMaster Bujold - Paladin of Souls 04-15"},{"id":4,"start":14127.596000000001,"end":18390.414,"title":"Lois McMaster Bujold - Paladin of Souls 05-15"},{"id":5,"start":18390.414,"end":22666.32,"title":"Lois McMaster Bujold - Paladin of Souls 06-15"},{"id":6,"start":22666.32,"end":23445.918999999998,"title":"Lois McMaster Bujold - Paladin of Souls 07-15"},{"id":7,"start":23445.918999999998,"end":27280.12,"title":"Lois McMaster Bujold - Paladin of Souls 08-15"},{"id":8,"start":27280.12,"end":30888.648999999998,"title":"Lois McMaster Bujold - Paladin of Souls 09-15"},{"id":9,"start":30888.648999999998,"end":35268.47,"title":"Lois McMaster Bujold - Paladin of Souls 10-15"},{"id":10,"start":35268.47,"end":39229.888,"title":"Lois McMaster Bujold - Paladin of Souls 11-15"},{"id":11,"start":39229.888,"end":43271.632,"title":"Lois McMaster Bujold - Paladin of Souls 12-15"},{"id":12,"start":43271.632,"end":46429.392,"title":"Lois McMaster Bujold - Paladin of Souls 13-15"},{"id":13,"start":46429.392,"end":50228.041,"title":"Lois McMaster Bujold - Paladin of Souls 14-15"},{"id":14,"start":50228.041,"end":53327.418,"title":"Lois McMaster Bujold - Paladin of Souls 15-15"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw12l4h5","ino":"12733594210598623990","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Six of Crows","subtitle":null,"author":"Leigh Bardugo","authorFL":"Leigh Bardugo","authorLF":"Bardugo, Leigh","narrator":"Jay Snyder; Brandon Rubin; Fred Berman; Lauren Fortgang; Roger Clark; Elizabeth Evans; Tristan Morris","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2015","publisher":null,"description":"Ketterdam: a bustling hub of international trade where anything can be had for the right price - and no one knows that better than criminal prodigy Kaz Brekker.

The government wants to capture the Shadow Man and has assigned the enigmatic Agent Franks to be Owen's full-time bodyguard, which is a polite way of saying that Owen is monster bait. With supernatural assassins targeting his family, a spy in their midst, and horrific beasties lurking around every corner, Owen and the staff of Monster Hunter International don't need to go hunting, because this time the monsters are hunting them. Fortunately, this bait is armed and very dangerous.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw12zjuv/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637005874655,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Larry Correia/Monster Hunter Vendetta","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Larry Correia/Monster Hunter Vendetta","addedAt":1637005800143,"lastUpdate":1637005874655,"duration":74518251,"size":455849231,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":18,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":4325.88,"title":"Monster Hunter Vendetta 01-18"},{"id":1,"start":4325.88,"end":8651.994999999999,"title":"Monster Hunter Vendetta 02-18"},{"id":2,"start":8651.994999999999,"end":12987.331999999999,"title":"Monster Hunter Vendetta 03-18"},{"id":3,"start":12987.331999999999,"end":17315.746,"title":"Monster Hunter Vendetta 04-18"},{"id":4,"start":17315.746,"end":21639.667,"title":"Monster Hunter Vendetta 05-18"},{"id":5,"start":21639.667,"end":25994.334000000003,"title":"Monster Hunter Vendetta 06-18"},{"id":6,"start":25994.334000000003,"end":30334.033000000003,"title":"Monster Hunter Vendetta 07-18"},{"id":7,"start":30334.033000000003,"end":34657.876000000004,"title":"Monster Hunter Vendetta 08-18"},{"id":8,"start":34657.876000000004,"end":38981.24800000001,"title":"Monster Hunter Vendetta 09-18"},{"id":9,"start":38981.24800000001,"end":43302.87000000001,"title":"Monster Hunter Vendetta 10-18"},{"id":10,"start":43302.87000000001,"end":47629.27300000001,"title":"Monster Hunter Vendetta 11-18"},{"id":11,"start":47629.27300000001,"end":51959.986000000004,"title":"Monster Hunter Vendetta 12-18"},{"id":12,"start":51959.986000000004,"end":56283.437000000005,"title":"Monster Hunter Vendetta 13-18"},{"id":13,"start":56283.437000000005,"end":60610.36200000001,"title":"Monster Hunter Vendetta 14-18"},{"id":14,"start":60610.36200000001,"end":64933.52500000001,"title":"Monster Hunter Vendetta 15-18"},{"id":15,"start":64933.52500000001,"end":69261.96500000001,"title":"Monster Hunter Vendetta 16-18"},{"id":16,"start":69261.96500000001,"end":73593.35700000002,"title":"Monster Hunter Vendetta 17-18"},{"id":17,"start":73593.35700000002,"end":74518.25100000002,"title":"Monster Hunter Vendetta 18-18"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw13elku","ino":"6324876801753075385","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Destroyer of Worlds","subtitle":null,"author":"Larry Correia","authorFL":"Larry Correia","authorLF":"Correia, Larry","narrator":"Tim Gerard Reynolds","series":"Saga of the Forgotten Warrior","volumeNumber":"3","publishYear":"2020","publisher":null,"description":"If it's war you want...find here the best of military epic fantasy as the best-selling Saga of the Forgotten Warrior series continues. The Great Extermination has begun. In the Capitol, Grand Inquisitor Omand Vokkan hatches a plot to kill every member of the untouchable caste in all of Lok, down to the last man, woman, and child. As a member of the Order of Inquisition, Vokkan has no official say in the creation of Law, but he has powerful allies willing to do his bidding. Through them, he has convinced the Judges that the genocide will be swift, complete, and without complication. Nothing is farther from the truth. Lord Protector Devedas has sworn to uphold the Law. Once, he and the traitor Ashok Vadal had been like brothers. Now, he hunts Vadal and the Sons of the Black Sword, heretics and rebels who seek to live outside the rule of the Law. All Devedas must do is find and kill his best friend and order will be restored to Lok. The rebels seek the secret kingdom spoken of by the Prophet Thera, a paradise where water is pure and food plentiful, where there are no castes, where the people rule themselves and are not slaves to the Capitol. Ashok Vadal is not sure he believes in such a Paradise, but he - along with his allies - does seek refuge in the rebellion’s hideout in Akershan. But Vadal, a former High Protector who has turned his back on the corrupt Law, will not merely wait meekly, hoping that fleeing to Akershan will spare the rebellion from the clutches of the Great Extermination. No, if it’s a war the Capitol wants, Vadal, who has faced down gods and demons, will be all too willing to give it to them.  PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be

Long ago, Susan Rodriguez was Harry Dresden's lover - until she was attacked by his enemies, leaving her torn between her own humanity and the bloodlust of the vampiric Red Court. Susan then disappeared to South America, where she could fight both her savage gift and those who cursed her with it. Now Arianna Ortega, Duchess of the Red Court, has discovered a secret Susan has long kept, and she plans to use it - against Harry. To prevail this time, he may have no choice but to embrace the raging fury of his own untapped dark power. Because Harry's not fighting to save the world...He's fighting to save his child.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw16o8m7/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637016139582,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Jim Butcher/The Dresden Files 12 -

She runs a quaint Victorian Bed and Breakfast in a small Texas town, owns a Shih Tzu named Beast, and is a perfect neighbor, whose biggest problem should be what to serve her guests for breakfast. But Dina is...different: Her broom is a deadly weapon; her Inn is magic and thinks for itself. Meant to be a lodging for otherworldly visitors, the only permanent guest is a retired Galactic aristocrat who can’t leave the grounds because she’s responsible for the deaths of millions and someone might shoot her on sight. Under the circumstances, \"normal\" is a bit of a stretch for Dina. And now, something with wicked claws and deepwater teeth has begun to hunt at night....Feeling responsible for her neighbors, Dina decides to get involved. Before long, she has to juggle dealing with the annoyingly attractive, ex-military, new neighbor, Sean Evans - an alpha-strain werewolf - and the equally arresting cosmic vampire soldier, Arland, while trying to keep her inn and its guests safe. But the enemy she’s facing is unlike anything she’s ever encountered before. It’s smart, vicious, and lethal, and putting herself between this creature and her neighbors might just cost her everything.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1fnw4z/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637027152155,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Ilona Andrews/Clean Sweep","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Ilona Andrews/Clean Sweep","addedAt":1637027091671,"lastUpdate":1637027152155,"duration":28502553,"size":174717200,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":17,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":2109.101,"title":"IACS01-17 Ilona Andrews - Clean Sweep"},{"id":1,"start":2109.101,"end":3940.181,"title":"IACS02-17 Ilona Andrews - Clean Sweep"},{"id":2,"start":3940.181,"end":5727.584,"title":"IACS03-17 Ilona Andrews - Clean Sweep"},{"id":3,"start":5727.584,"end":7488.864,"title":"IACS04-17 Ilona Andrews - Clean Sweep"},{"id":4,"start":7488.864,"end":9054.617999999999,"title":"IACS05-17 Ilona Andrews - Clean Sweep"},{"id":5,"start":9054.617999999999,"end":10985.223999999998,"title":"IACS06-17 Ilona Andrews - Clean Sweep"},{"id":6,"start":10985.223999999998,"end":12847.336999999998,"title":"IACS07-17 Ilona Andrews - Clean Sweep"},{"id":7,"start":12847.336999999998,"end":14395.248999999998,"title":"IACS08-17 Ilona Andrews - Clean Sweep"},{"id":8,"start":14395.248999999998,"end":15226.413999999997,"title":"IACS09-17 Ilona Andrews - Clean Sweep"},{"id":9,"start":15226.413999999997,"end":16835.426999999996,"title":"IACS10-17 Ilona Andrews - Clean Sweep"},{"id":10,"start":16835.426999999996,"end":18808.821999999996,"title":"IACS11-17 Ilona Andrews - Clean Sweep"},{"id":11,"start":18808.821999999996,"end":20164.368999999995,"title":"IACS12-17 Ilona Andrews - Clean Sweep"},{"id":12,"start":20164.368999999995,"end":21974.680999999997,"title":"IACS13-17 Ilona Andrews - Clean Sweep"},{"id":13,"start":21974.680999999997,"end":23585.600999999995,"title":"IACS14-17 Ilona Andrews - Clean Sweep"},{"id":14,"start":23585.600999999995,"end":25016.667999999994,"title":"IACS15-17 Ilona Andrews - Clean Sweep"},{"id":15,"start":25016.667999999994,"end":28235.841999999993,"title":"IACS16-17 Ilona Andrews - Clean Sweep"},{"id":16,"start":28235.841999999993,"end":28502.552999999993,"title":"IACS17-17 Ilona Andrews - Clean Sweep"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1g1ovt","ino":"12060721600943085991","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Tigana","subtitle":null,"author":"Guy Gavriel Kay","authorFL":"Guy Gavriel Kay","authorLF":"Kay, Guy Gavriel","narrator":"Simon Vance","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"1990","publisher":null,"description":"Acclaimed author Guy Gavriel Kay has been honored with the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel (Ysabel) and the International Goliardos Award for his work in fantasy.  Eight of the nine Palm provinces of the Peninsula have been overcome by warrior sorcerers Brandin and Alberico.

Defeated by the Lady and cast from this world, all that was left of him was a foul trace of lingering evil. But the graveyard that was once the Barrowland contains more secrets than dead. All who would possess the power of the Dominator are drawn to the spike. A foolhardy band of thieves is the first to reach it, and a rapacious and malign spirit is unleashed on an unwary world. The forces gather, sides are drawn, and mortal men can only die as the Dark Lords battle for domination.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1hpk1d/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction &

Beartown and A Man Called Ove, a heart-wrenching story of how loyalty, friendship, and love carry a town through its darkest days. After everything that the citizens of Beartown have gone through, they are struck yet another blow when they learn that their beloved local hockey team will soon be disbanded. What makes it worse is the obvious satisfaction that all the former Beartown players, who now play for a rival team in Hed, take in that fact. Amidst the mounting tension between the two rivals, a surprising newcomer is handpicked to be Beartown's new hockey coach. Soon a new team starts to take shape around Amat, the fastest player you'll ever see; Benji, the crazed lone wolf; and Vidar, a born-to-be-bad troublemaker. Bringing this team together is a challenge as old bonds are broken, new ones are formed, and the enmity with Hed grows more and more acute. As the big match approaches, the not-so-innocent pranks and incidents between the communities pile up, and hatred grows deeper. When the last game is finally played, one of Beartown's key players will be dead, and residents of both towns are forced to wonder whether, after all they've been through, the game they love can ever return to something simple and innocent. Us Against You is a declaration of love for all the big and small, bright and dark stories that form and color our communities. Compelling and heartbreaking, it's a roller-coaster ride of emotions with Fredrik \"Backman's pitch-perfect dialogue and an unparalleled understanding of human nature\" (Shelf Awareness).","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw1jjk2j/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Fredrik Backman/Us Against You/cover.jpg","genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre

He’s a curmudgeon - the kind of man who points at people he dislikes as if they were burglars caught outside his bedroom window. He has staunch principles, strict routines, and a short fuse. People call him “the bitter neighbor from hell”. But must Ove be bitter just because he doesn’t walk around with a smile plastered to his face all the time? Behind the cranky exterior there is a story and a sadness. So when one November morning a chatty young couple with two chatty young daughters move in next door and accidentally flatten Ove’s mailbox, it is the lead-in to a comical and heartwarming tale of unkempt cats, unexpected friendship, and the ancient art of backing up a U-Haul. All of which will change one cranky old man and a local residents’ association to their very foundations. Fredrik Backman’s novel about the angry old man next door is a thoughtful exploration of the profound impact one life has on countless others.  “If there was an award for ‘Most Charming Book of the Year,’ this first novel by a Swedish blogger-turned-overnight-sensation would win hands down.” (Booklist, starred review)","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1jydm9/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637034424523,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Fredrik Backman/A Man Called Ove","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Fredrik Backman/A Man Called Ove","addedAt":1637034298596,"lastUpdate":1637034424523,"duration":33193170,"size":407322279,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":42,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":32.44,"title":"000 -

part of the expanded universe based on the award-winning video game series Halo! The 26th century. Humanity has expanded beyond Earth’s system to hundreds of planets that colonists now call home. But the United Earth Government and the United Nations Space Command is struggling to control this vast empire. After exhausting all strategies to keep seething colonial insurrections from exploding into a full-blown interplanetary civil war, the UNSC has one last hope. At the Office of Naval Intelligence, Dr. Catherine Halsey has been hard at work on a top-secret program that could bring an end to the conflict...and it starts with 75 children, among them a six-year-old boy named John. And Halsey could never guess that this child will eventually become the final hope against an even greater peril engulfing the galaxy - the inexorable confrontation with a theocratic military alliance of alien races known as the Covenant. This is the electrifying origin story of Spartan John-117 - the Master Chief - and of his legendary, unstoppable heroism in leading the resistance against humanity’s possible extinction.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1kwbhb/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637036164608,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Eric Nylund/The Fall of Reach","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Eric Nylund/The Fall of Reach","addedAt":1637035882127,"lastUpdate":1637036164608,"duration":40025663,"size":355042813,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":39,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":1043.672,"title":"Prologue"},{"id":1,"start":1043.672,"end":2082.093,"title":"Chapter 01"},{"id":2,"start":2082.093,"end":2877.236,"title":"Chapter 02"},{"id":3,"start":2877.236,"end":3390.674,"title":"Chapter 03"},{"id":4,"start":3390.674,"end":4666.914,"title":"Chapter 04"},{"id":5,"start":4666.914,"end":5906.112,"title":"Chapter 05"},{"id":6,"start":5906.112,"end":6480.912,"title":"Chapter 06"},{"id":7,"start":6480.912,"end":7664.156,"title":"Chapter 07"},{"id":8,"start":7664.156,"end":8434.326,"title":"Chapter 08"},{"id":9,"start":8434.326,"end":9255.564999999999,"title":"Chapter 09"},{"id":10,"start":9255.564999999999,"end":10881.688999999998,"title":"Chapter 10"},{"id":11,"start":10881.688999999998,"end":11886.725999999999,"title":"Chapter 11"},{"id":12,"start":11886.725999999999,"end":13260.873,"title":"Chapter 12"},{"id":13,"start":13260.873,"end":13959.363,"title":"Chapter 13"},{"id":14,"start":13959.363,"end":15369.089,"title":"Chapter 14"},{"id":15,"start":15369.089,"end":16056.921,"title":"Chapter 15"},{"id":16,"start":16056.921,"end":16967.943,"title":"Chapter 16"},{"id":17,"start":16967.943,"end":18158.162,"title":"Chapter 17"},{"id":18,"start":18158.162,"end":19253.373,"title":"Chapter 18"},{"id":19,"start":19253.373,"end":20574.021,"title":"Chapter 19"},{"id":20,"start":20574.021,"end":22042.783,"title":"Chapter 20"},{"id":21,"start":22042.783,"end":23755.451,"title":"Chapter 21"},{"id":22,"start":23755.451,"end":25079.417,"title":"Chapter 22"},{"id":23,"start":25079.417,"end":25671.745000000003,"title":"Chapter 23"},{"id":24,"start":25671.745000000003,"end":26916.978000000003,"title":"Chapter 24"},{"id":25,"start":26916.978000000003,"end":28303.376000000004,"title":"Chapter 25"},{"id":26,"start":28303.376000000004,"end":29142.613000000005,"title":"Chapter 26"},{"id":27,"start":29142.613000000005,"end":31560.639000000003,"title":"Chapter 27"},{"id":28,"start":31560.639000000003,"end":32294.603000000003,"title":"Chapter 28"},{"id":29,"start":32294.603000000003,"end":33258.889,"title":"Chapter 29"},{"id":30,"start":33258.889,"end":33369.075000000004,"title":"Chapter 30"},{"id":31,"start":33369.075000000004,"end":33902.236000000004,"title":"Chapter 31"},{"id":32,"start":33902.236000000004,"end":34461.023,"title":"Chapter 32"},{"id":33,"start":34461.023,"end":35648.865,"title":"Chapter 33"},{"id":34,"start":35648.865,"end":36170.14,"title":"Chapter 34"},{"id":35,"start":36170.14,"end":37484.911,"title":"Chapter 35"},{"id":36,"start":37484.911,"end":38476.416,"title":"Chapter 36"},{"id":37,"start":38476.416,"end":39315.653,"title":"Chapter 37"},{"id":38,"start":39315.653,"end":40025.663,"title":"Epilogue"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1l2df0","ino":"12114631995458306085","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Ghost of Onyx","subtitle":null,"author":"Eric Nylund","authorFL":"Eric Nylund","authorLF":"Nylund, Eric","narrator":"Jonathan Davis","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2006","publisher":null,"description":"The New York Times best-seller - part of the expanded universe based on the award-winning video game series Halo!

While the Master Chief defends a besieged Earth and the myriad factions of the Covenant continue their crusade to eliminate humanity, an ultra-secret cell of the Office of Naval Intelligence known as “Section Three” devises a plan to buy the UNSC vital time. It will need hundreds of willing soldiers, though - and one more Spartan - to get the job done. The planet Onyx is virtually abandoned and the perfect place to set this new plan in motion. But when the Master Chief destroys Halo, something is triggered deep within Onyx: Ancient Forerunner technology stirs, and fleets of UNSC and Covenant vessels race to claim it and change the course of the Human-Covenant War.

If his classmates want to survive the summer, their infamous intern is the only chance they’ve got.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1lppxu/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Science Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637037412771,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Elliott Kay/Last Man Out","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Elliott Kay/Last Man Out","addedAt":1637037253823,"lastUpdate":1637037412771,"duration":69760660,"size":557509730,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":39,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":939.805,"title":"Chapter 1"},{"id":1,"start":939.805,"end":3375.254,"title":"Chapter 2"},{"id":2,"start":3375.254,"end":4538.714,"title":"Chapter 3"},{"id":3,"start":4538.714,"end":7136.192,"title":"Chapter 4"},{"id":4,"start":7136.192,"end":8625.706,"title":"Chapter 5"},{"id":5,"start":8625.706,"end":10644.171,"title":"Chapter 6"},{"id":6,"start":10644.171,"end":12128.391,"title":"Chapter 7"},{"id":7,"start":12128.391,"end":14623.608,"title":"Chapter 8"},{"id":8,"start":14623.608,"end":15732.501,"title":"Chapter 9"},{"id":9,"start":15732.501,"end":17685.393,"title":"Chapter 10"},{"id":10,"start":17685.393,"end":19942.186999999998,"title":"Chapter 11"},{"id":11,"start":19942.186999999998,"end":21679.551,"title":"Chapter 12"},{"id":12,"start":21679.551,"end":24867.326,"title":"Chapter 13"},{"id":13,"start":24867.326,"end":26157.288,"title":"Chapter 14"},{"id":14,"start":26157.288,"end":28193.307,"title":"Chapter 15"},{"id":15,"start":28193.307,"end":30051.786,"title":"Chapter 16"},{"id":16,"start":30051.786,"end":32151.195,"title":"Chapter 17"},{"id":17,"start":32151.195,"end":35011.383,"title":"Chapter 18"},{"id":18,"start":35011.383,"end":36338.729,"title":"Chapter 19"},{"id":19,"start":36338.729,"end":37889.265,"title":"Chapter 20"},{"id":20,"start":37889.265,"end":39428.377,"title":"Chapter 21"},{"id":21,"start":39428.377,"end":41163.14,"title":"Chapter 22"},{"id":22,"start":41163.14,"end":42881.695999999996,"title":"Chapter 23"},{"id":23,"start":42881.695999999996,"end":44781.738999999994,"title":"Chapter 24"},{"id":24,"start":44781.738999999994,"end":46413.219999999994,"title":"Chapter 25"},{"id":25,"start":46413.219999999994,"end":48758.435999999994,"title":"Chapter 26"},{"id":26,"start":48758.435999999994,"end":50394.42199999999,"title":"Chapter 27"},{"id":27,"start":50394.42199999999,"end":51624.382999999994,"title":"Chapter 28"},{"id":28,"start":51624.382999999994,"end":53053.94299999999,"title":"Chapter 29"},{"id":29,"start":53053.94299999999,"end":54732.46799999999,"title":"Chapter 30"},{"id":30,"start":54732.46799999999,"end":56082.94099999999,"title":"Chapter 31"},{"id":31,"start":56082.94099999999,"end":57875.28999999999,"title":"Chapter 32"},{"id":32,"start":57875.28999999999,"end":59575.873999999996,"title":"Chapter 33"},{"id":33,"start":59575.873999999996,"end":61323.361999999994,"title":"Chapter 34"},{"id":34,"start":61323.361999999994,"end":62845.895,"title":"Chapter 35"},{"id":35,"start":62845.895,"end":64438.181,"title":"Chapter 36"},{"id":36,"start":64438.181,"end":66489.014,"title":"Chapter 37"},{"id":37,"start":66489.014,"end":68665.65299999999,"title":"Chapter 38"},{"id":38,"start":68665.65299999999,"end":69760.65999999999,"title":"Chapter 39"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1lugkm","ino":"6554538603160117038","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Wrath of Gods","subtitle":"The Paternus Trilogy, Book 2","author":"Dyrk Ashton","authorFL":"Dyrk Ashton","authorLF":"Ashton, Dyrk","narrator":"Nik Magill","series":"The Paternus Trilogy","volumeNumber":"2","publishYear":"2018","publisher":null,"description":"Paternus: Wrath of Gods is the highly anticipated follow-up to Dyrk Ashton's critically acclaimed, Amazon number-one best-selling novel Paternus: Rise of Gods and the second book in the Paternus Trilogy. \"What a sequel should be - bigger stakes, bloodier action, and even more mythological madness.\" (Fantasy Book Critic) On the run from an ancient evil and his army of terrors straight out of myths from around the world, Fi and Zeke aid Peter in his globe-trotting quest to seek out the remaining Firstborn, uncover the enemy's plans, and gather the warriors of old for what may become the final battle in the world's oldest war.

That would be the motto of Lander University, had it not been snatched up and used to death by others long before the school was founded. For while Lander offers a full range of courses to nearly all students, it also offers a small number of specialty classes to a very select few. Lander is home to the Hero Certification Program, a curriculum designed to develop students with superhuman capabilities, commonly known as Supers, into official Heroes. Five of this year's freshmen are extra special. They have a secret aside from their abilities - one that they must guard from even their classmates. For every one person in the world with abilities they can control, there are three who lack such skill. These lesser super beings - Powereds, as they are called - have always been treated as burdens and second-class citizens. Though there has been ample research in the area, no one has ever succeeded in turning a Powered into a regular human, let alone a Super. That is, until now....","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1m7uoq/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Action &

Bob Johansson has just sold his software company for a small fortune and is looking forward to a life of leisure. The first item on his to-do list: Spending his newfound windfall. On an urge to splurge, he signs up to have his head cryogenically preserved in case of death. Then he gets himself killed crossing the street. Waking up 117 years later, Bob discovers his mind has been uploaded into a sentient space probe with the ability to replicate itself. Bob and his clones are on a mission to find new homes for humanity and boldly go where no Bob has gone before.  Dennis E. Taylor’s hilarious novel sets the stage for the magnificent performance of Ray Porter, who revels in the brave new world of corpsicles, artificial intelligence, interstellar space probes, and space colonization in tantalizing detail.  We Are Legion (We Are Bob) is the first installment in the blockbuster Audible Original Bobiverse series - which has sold more than one million copies.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw1mrfqr/51rt2pFIW7L._SL500_.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Dennis E.

Invocations tearing the land asunder. The war has arrived. The necromantic armies are on the warpath and nowhere is safe—even the sanctuary of the flying dungeon has been threatened. The leadership of nearly all the sentient races has been wiped out, and only the people most suited to repelling the advancing darkness have an intact monarchy. Cal learns quickly that the primary threat is not the far-off war, but the actions of those entrusted with protecting the population. As it turns out, the idea of using a flying dungeon as a war machine is very tempting indeed. Dale has been facing his trials better than anyone could have hoped for, but when the war takes a turn for the worse, his role is forcibly relinquished. Since his only chance at survival is painful and rapid advancement, Dale must learn if his strength of will can develop into strength of flesh. The distance between the Heavens and the Earth might not be so far after all.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1nkvzf/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637040389985,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Dakota Krout/Dungeon Desolation","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Dakota Krout/Dungeon Desolation","addedAt":1637040388438,"lastUpdate":1637040389985,"duration":42962489,"size":341146474,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":1,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":385.497,"title":"001"},{"id":1,"start":385.497,"end":1075.919,"title":"002"},{"id":2,"start":1075.919,"end":1740.474,"title":"003"},{"id":3,"start":1740.474,"end":2467.956,"title":"004"},{"id":4,"start":2467.956,"end":3279.261,"title":"005"},{"id":5,"start":3279.261,"end":4160.458,"title":"006"},{"id":6,"start":4160.458,"end":4894.162,"title":"007"},{"id":7,"start":4894.162,"end":5626.798,"title":"008"},{"id":8,"start":5626.798,"end":6269.294,"title":"009"},{"id":9,"start":6269.294,"end":7052.225,"title":"010"},{"id":10,"start":7052.225,"end":7713.854,"title":"011"},{"id":11,"start":7713.854,"end":8368.332,"title":"012"},{"id":12,"start":8368.332,"end":8992.809,"title":"013"},{"id":13,"start":8992.809,"end":9761.947,"title":"014"},{"id":14,"start":9761.947,"end":10828.115,"title":"015"},{"id":15,"start":10828.115,"end":11515.797,"title":"016"},{"id":16,"start":11515.797,"end":12321.158,"title":"017"},{"id":17,"start":12321.158,"end":13161.766,"title":"018"},{"id":18,"start":13161.766,"end":13784.618,"title":"019"},{"id":19,"start":13784.618,"end":14507.409,"title":"020"},{"id":20,"start":14507.409,"end":15137.645,"title":"021"},{"id":21,"start":15137.645,"end":15807.68,"title":"022"},{"id":22,"start":15807.68,"end":16368.117,"title":"023"},{"id":23,"start":16368.117,"end":16982.656,"title":"024"},{"id":24,"start":16982.656,"end":17733.961,"title":"025"},{"id":25,"start":17733.961,"end":18334.522,"title":"026"},{"id":26,"start":18334.522,"end":18952.126,"title":"027"},{"id":27,"start":18952.126,"end":19833.974,"title":"028"},{"id":28,"start":19833.974,"end":20464.489,"title":"029"},{"id":29,"start":20464.489,"end":21068.625,"title":"030"},{"id":30,"start":21068.625,"end":21867.113,"title":"031"},{"id":31,"start":21867.113,"end":22419.748,"title":"032"},{"id":32,"start":22419.748,"end":23155.356,"title":"033"},{"id":33,"start":23155.356,"end":24069.897,"title":"034"},{"id":34,"start":24069.897,"end":24744.53,"title":"035"},{"id":35,"start":24744.53,"end":25390.927,"title":"036"},{"id":36,"start":25390.927,"end":25886.673,"title":"037"},{"id":37,"start":25886.673,"end":26564.464,"title":"038"},{"id":38,"start":26564.464,"end":27315.35,"title":"039"},{"id":39,"start":27315.35,"end":28055.928,"title":"040"},{"id":40,"start":28055.928,"end":28837.326,"title":"041"},{"id":41,"start":28837.326,"end":29433.335,"title":"042"},{"id":42,"start":29433.335,"end":30108.386,"title":"043"},{"id":43,"start":30108.386,"end":30651.64,"title":"044"},{"id":44,"start":30651.64,"end":31319.074,"title":"045"},{"id":45,"start":31319.074,"end":31885.223,"title":"046"},{"id":46,"start":31885.223,"end":32694.021,"title":"047"},{"id":47,"start":32694.021,"end":33347.012,"title":"048"},{"id":48,"start":33347.012,"end":34114.014,"title":"049"},{"id":49,"start":34114.014,"end":34760.132,"title":"050"},{"id":50,"start":34760.132,"end":35423.991,"title":"051"},{"id":51,"start":35423.991,"end":36076.564,"title":"052"},{"id":52,"start":36076.564,"end":36804.231,"title":"053"},{"id":53,"start":36804.231,"end":37470.505,"title":"054"},{"id":54,"start":37470.505,"end":38369.953,"title":"055"},{"id":55,"start":38369.953,"end":38967.077,"title":"056"},{"id":56,"start":38967.077,"end":39593.273,"title":"057"},{"id":57,"start":39593.273,"end":40495.415,"title":"058"},{"id":58,"start":40495.415,"end":41190.109,"title":"059"},{"id":59,"start":41190.109,"end":41821.506,"title":"060"},{"id":60,"start":41821.506,"end":42539.142,"title":"061"},{"id":61,"start":42539.142,"end":42962.489,"title":"062"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1pnm44","ino":"7004278873969502351","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Josh and Hazels Guide to Not Dating","subtitle":null,"author":"Christina Lauren","authorFL":"Christina Lauren","authorLF":"Lauren, Christina","narrator":"Todd Haberkorn; Jayme Mattler","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2018","publisher":null,"description":"The New York Times best-selling “romance It Girls” (Kirkus) bring you a hilarious, sexy romance about love perpetually unrequited (and denied), in the vein of their Roomies and Beautiful Bastard.

A legendary sword. A young man's journey to find his destiny.   Aren has lived by the rules all his life. He's never questioned it; that's just the way things are. But then his father is executed for treason, and he and his best friend, Cade, are thrown into a prison mine, doomed to work until they drop. Unless they can somehow break free....  But what lies beyond the prison walls is more terrifying still. Rescued by a man who hates him yet is oath-bound to protect him, pursued by inhuman forces, Aren slowly accepts that everything he knew about his world was a lie.

A revolution is brewing, and Aren is being drawn into it, whether he likes it or not.   The key to the revolution is the Ember Blade. The sword of kings, the Excalibur of his people. Only with the Ember Blade in hand can their people be inspired to rise up...but it's locked in an impenetrable vault in the most heavily guarded fortress in the land.   All they have to do now is steal it....

Quin Tern of Azbar has met his fate, and his council has borne the price of crossing Raz i'Syul Arro. Now, as the cruel walls of the city fade into the winter storms at his back, Raz rides north, seeking to take the High Priest Talo Brahnt up on an offer he never should have refused. The path Raz has chosen, though, is a bloody one, and before long he and his new companions find themselves pitted against hardships they can neither anticipate nor ignore. As man and snow and beast alike rise up to block their path, it seems almost as though the North itself has woken to wage war against the Monster. And yet, Raz's greatest challenge still looms ahead. Far to the north, like a plague beneath the trees, Gûlraht Baoill, Kayle of the savage mountain tribes, leads his armies further east with each passing day. He has set his hungry gaze upon the reaches of Cyurgi' Di, the High Citadel, and desires nothing more than to see it razed from the face of the world, offering it and its blasphemous \"false-prophets\" up as sacrifice to his Stone Gods. Syrah Brahnt, the High Priest's adopted daughter and protégé, has found him out, discovering his plan to lay siege to her home, cutting her and the rest of the Laorin off from the world. As it is, though, there is little and less that she can do, and when the first of the Kayle's generals reaches the base of the mountain pass, Syrah is left with only one option. In the end, she will have to face the wrath of the tribes herself.... Little does she know that the Monster is coming, riding hard to lend her his blades.

To the south, the Mahsadën of Miropa are gone. The šef lay dead, slain at Raz's own hands, their cruel will ripped from the shadows of the city. In response, riders careen to every reachable corner of the known realms, telling anyone with a mind to listen of the boundless riches promised for the Monster's head. The world now turned against him, Raz is forced to flee, escaping along the northern roads just as the summer months come to an end. For a time the coolness and breathtaking verdure of the great rolling woodlands he finds himself in are a welcome change, offering a sublime peace from a life that has rarely known more than brutality and bloodshed. But that peace - as is so often the case - is a shallow trickery. The North, it seems, is not far-gone from the corruption and wickedness Raz had hoped to leave behind in the fringe cities. Before long he finds himself embroiled in the savage politics of this new land, forced to play a part in the ugly game of intrigue and violence once more. To survive, Raz must again give way to the Monster, making his stand within the devouring walls of the cruel coliseum the Northerners call simply \"the Arena\". Blood, after all, freezes as hard and cold as anything else.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1ps81x/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637044229844,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Bryce O'Connor/The Warring Son","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Bryce O'Connor/The Warring Son","addedAt":1637044089750,"lastUpdate":1637044229845,"duration":42358420,"size":342287344,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":44,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":8.871,"title":"Opening Credits"},{"id":1,"start":8.871,"end":593.504,"title":"Prologue"},{"id":2,"start":593.504,"end":1157.0059999999999,"title":"Chapter 1"},{"id":3,"start":1157.0059999999999,"end":1493.7419999999997,"title":"Chapter 2"},{"id":4,"start":1493.7419999999997,"end":2730.8549999999996,"title":"Chapter 3"},{"id":5,"start":2730.8549999999996,"end":3838.8189999999995,"title":"Chapter 4"},{"id":6,"start":3838.8189999999995,"end":4835.187999999999,"title":"Chapter 5"},{"id":7,"start":4835.187999999999,"end":5879.157999999999,"title":"Chapter 6"},{"id":8,"start":5879.157999999999,"end":6738.5289999999995,"title":"Chapter 7"},{"id":9,"start":6738.5289999999995,"end":8718.541,"title":"Chapter 8"},{"id":10,"start":8718.541,"end":10016.862,"title":"Chapter 9"},{"id":11,"start":10016.862,"end":11372.350999999999,"title":"Chapter 10"},{"id":12,"start":11372.350999999999,"end":12590.981,"title":"Chapter 11"},{"id":13,"start":12590.981,"end":13882.382,"title":"Chapter 12"},{"id":14,"start":13882.382,"end":14425.358,"title":"Chapter 13"},{"id":15,"start":14425.358,"end":15958.247,"title":"Chapter 14"},{"id":16,"start":15958.247,"end":16703.051,"title":"Chapter 15"},{"id":17,"start":16703.051,"end":18299.609,"title":"Chapter 16"},{"id":18,"start":18299.609,"end":19808.21,"title":"Chapter 17"},{"id":19,"start":19808.21,"end":20743.139,"title":"Chapter 18"},{"id":20,"start":20743.139,"end":22119.943,"title":"Chapter 19"},{"id":21,"start":22119.943,"end":23360.539,"title":"Chapter 20"},{"id":22,"start":23360.539,"end":24080.405,"title":"Chapter 21"},{"id":23,"start":24080.405,"end":26373.376,"title":"Chapter 22"},{"id":24,"start":26373.376,"end":28111.111,"title":"Chapter 23"},{"id":25,"start":28111.111,"end":28483.513,"title":"Chapter 24"},{"id":26,"start":28483.513,"end":29267.976,"title":"Chapter 25"},{"id":27,"start":29267.976,"end":30119.824,"title":"Chapter 26"},{"id":28,"start":30119.824,"end":31778.612,"title":"Chapter 27"},{"id":29,"start":31778.612,"end":32405.087,"title":"Chapter 28"},{"id":30,"start":32405.087,"end":32721.667999999998,"title":"Chapter 29"},{"id":31,"start":32721.667999999998,"end":33117.708,"title":"Chapter 30"},{"id":32,"start":33117.708,"end":34074.464,"title":"Chapter 31"},{"id":33,"start":34074.464,"end":35608.653,"title":"Chapter 32"},{"id":34,"start":35608.653,"end":36197.651,"title":"Chapter 33"},{"id":35,"start":36197.651,"end":36952.95,"title":"Chapter 34"},{"id":36,"start":36952.95,"end":37834.566,"title":"Chapter 35"},{"id":37,"start":37834.566,"end":38902.034,"title":"Chapter 36"},{"id":38,"start":38902.034,"end":39727.736,"title":"Chapter 37"},{"id":39,"start":39727.736,"end":40743.238,"title":"Chapter 38"},{"id":40,"start":40743.238,"end":41637.996,"title":"Chapter 39"},{"id":41,"start":41637.996,"end":42115.445,"title":"Chapter 40"},{"id":42,"start":42115.445,"end":42331.995,"title":"Epilogue"},{"id":43,"start":42331.995,"end":42358.420000000006,"title":"End Credits"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1q7727","ino":"18143055850056015420","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Child of the Daystar","subtitle":null,"author":"Bryce O'Connor","authorFL":"Bryce O'Connor","authorLF":"O'Connor, Bryce","narrator":"Mikael Naramore","series":"The Wings of War","volumeNumber":"1","publishYear":"2015","publisher":null,"description":"Among the scattered fringe cities bordering the Cienbal desert, the true name of the Monster of Karth is spoken only in whispers...RAZ I'SYUL ARRO. A sellsword of the utmost caliber, Raz is a killer of paramount skill and highest regard. Towering tall even amongst the atherian, he is the only of his kind to live free in the \"civilized\" confines of mankind's varied cultures. He has no need of loyalties, his sole affections pledged to the gold crowns that buy his time and skills. Wed to his blades, Raz's only friends are the Moon and Her Stars and the shadows they bring with the night. But Raz was not born to the mercenary's way, to the butchery and battle of day-by-day survival. Raz, like a sword, was hammered from steel and fire and ashy smoke, forged on the ruins of an old life. And Raz knows who he owes this new path to, this carved way of blood and iron. The Monster of Karth, after all, would never forget who gave him that name. And some debts can't be paid in gold....","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1q7727/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637044931559,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Bryce O'Connor/Child of the Daystar","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Bryce O'Connor/Child of the Daystar","addedAt":1637044788468,"lastUpdate":1637044931559,"duration":39879270,"size":319274939,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":42,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":686.243,"title":"Chapter 1"},{"id":1,"start":686.243,"end":1830.9410000000003,"title":"Chapter 2"},{"id":2,"start":1830.9410000000003,"end":3343.2570000000005,"title":"Chapter 3"},{"id":3,"start":3343.2570000000005,"end":3885.9540000000006,"title":"Chapter 4"},{"id":4,"start":3885.9540000000006,"end":4856.967000000001,"title":"Chapter 5"},{"id":5,"start":4856.967000000001,"end":5874.048000000001,"title":"Chapter 6"},{"id":6,"start":5874.048000000001,"end":6753.388000000001,"title":"Chapter 7"},{"id":7,"start":6753.388000000001,"end":8148.629000000001,"title":"Chapter 8"},{"id":8,"start":8148.629000000001,"end":8954.501,"title":"Chapter 9"},{"id":9,"start":8954.501,"end":10215.299,"title":"Chapter 10"},{"id":10,"start":10215.299,"end":10514.837000000001,"title":"Chapter 11"},{"id":11,"start":10514.837000000001,"end":11085.630000000001,"title":"Chapter 12"},{"id":12,"start":11085.630000000001,"end":12059.475,"title":"Chapter 13"},{"id":13,"start":12059.475,"end":13381.295,"title":"Chapter 14"},{"id":14,"start":13381.295,"end":14333.546,"title":"Chapter 15"},{"id":15,"start":14333.546,"end":14948.039,"title":"Chapter 16"},{"id":16,"start":14948.039,"end":15857.054,"title":"Chapter 17"},{"id":17,"start":15857.054,"end":16604.18,"title":"Chapter 18"},{"id":18,"start":16604.18,"end":18617.536,"title":"Chapter 19"},{"id":19,"start":18617.536,"end":19181.549,"title":"Chapter 20"},{"id":20,"start":19181.549,"end":21137.691,"title":"Chapter 21"},{"id":21,"start":21137.691,"end":21718.468999999997,"title":"Chapter 22"},{"id":22,"start":21718.468999999997,"end":21935.157999999996,"title":"Chapter 23"},{"id":23,"start":21935.157999999996,"end":23100.242999999995,"title":"Chapter 24"},{"id":24,"start":23100.242999999995,"end":25030.750999999997,"title":"Chapter 25"},{"id":25,"start":25030.750999999997,"end":25684.996999999996,"title":"Chapter 26"},{"id":26,"start":25684.996999999996,"end":26367.524999999994,"title":"Chapter 27"},{"id":27,"start":26367.524999999994,"end":27595.164999999994,"title":"Chapter 28"},{"id":28,"start":27595.164999999994,"end":29648.041999999994,"title":"Chapter 29"},{"id":29,"start":29648.041999999994,"end":30578.140999999992,"title":"Chapter 30"},{"id":30,"start":30578.140999999992,"end":31517.388999999992,"title":"Chapter 31"},{"id":31,"start":31517.388999999992,"end":31767.375999999993,"title":"Chapter 32"},{"id":32,"start":31767.375999999993,"end":32829.549999999996,"title":"Chapter 33"},{"id":33,"start":32829.549999999996,"end":33550.251,"title":"Chapter 34"},{"id":34,"start":33550.251,"end":34281.075999999994,"title":"Chapter 35"},{"id":35,"start":34281.075999999994,"end":34806.35799999999,"title":"Chapter 36"},{"id":36,"start":34806.35799999999,"end":35803.329999999994,"title":"Chapter 37"},{"id":37,"start":35803.329999999994,"end":37202.935999999994,"title":"Chapter 38"},{"id":38,"start":37202.935999999994,"end":37970.587999999996,"title":"Chapter 39"},{"id":39,"start":37970.587999999996,"end":39201.293,"title":"Chapter 40"},{"id":40,"start":39201.293,"end":39686.032999999996,"title":"Chapter 41"},{"id":41,"start":39686.032999999996,"end":39879.27,"title":"Chapter 42"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1qaa1n","ino":"1629902823036498643","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"As Iron Falls","subtitle":null,"author":"Bryce O'Connor","authorFL":"Bryce O'Connor","authorLF":"O'Connor, Bryce","narrator":"Mikael Naramore","series":"The Wings of War","volumeNumber":"4","publishYear":"2018","publisher":null,"description":"The High Citadel cannot be seen to harbor a killer.  This is a simple truth, and one that Raz i’Syul Arro has little choice but to respect. As the winter storms fall away in favor of the North’s pleasant summer months, Raz finds himself having once more to face the cruelties of the world with spear and sword in hand.  For the first time, though, the Monster no longer walks his path alone. Syrah Brahnt, Priestess of Laor and adopted daughter of the former High Priest of Cyurgi ‘Di himself, has joined him on his journey. Leaving all that might have been behind, they set out together in search of new lives, always striving to stay ahead of the ever-looming shadows of old enemies that hound their every step.  Raz’s legend, though, has spread too far. After vanquishing the great Kayle of the Northern tribes, his names have begun to echo across the realms: Monster of Karth, Scourge of the South, Dragon of the North. It isn’t long before they are forced to draw on magic and steel to save themselves from the blades that seek them in the night, leaving them with little choice but to abandon everything they’ve ever known in favor of a perilous land neither would have every thought to seek. Meanwhile, waiting for them among the grasslands beyond those strange shores, a man whispers in his sleep, his iron shackles shaking as he trembles and repeats the same prophetic words over and over

He knows of the bastards and brigands who plague the King's lands, of the monsters skulking in the wooded depths of the realm. Together with his companion, Ryn - a beast of rather peculiar talent - he has spent the last decade of his life beneath the bloody banners of a half-dozen mercenary guilds, hunting precisely such festering wickedness within the borders of Viridian. Unfortunately, fate is quick to pull on the leash of its favorite children. When one particularly troubling contract goes sideways, Declan and Ryn find themselves thrust into a war thought legend and long-ended, a conflict so old it is synonymous with a time in which dragons still ruled the western skies. Now, as dead men rise from their graves and the terrible beasts of the northern ranges descend into the kingdom with an appetite for savagery and flesh, Declan is faced with a profane choice. He can turn, can flee an ancient rising horror that would see the realms of man left as shattered death and wind-blown ash. Or, Declan can face this mounting threat, can come to terms with the fact that his oldest friend might just be more than he appears, and learn to wield an ageless power all his own. Centuries pass, after all, but the Blood of Kings does not fade....","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1qe1s0/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction &

of 2020 by The New York Times * The Washington Post * NPR * People * Time Magazine * Vanity Fair * Glamour “Bennett’s tone and style recalls James Baldwin and Jacqueline Woodson, but it’s especially reminiscent of Toni Morrison’s 1970 debut novel, The Bluest Eye.” (Kiley Reid, Wall Street Journal) “A story of absolute, universal timelessness.... For any era, it's an accomplished, affecting novel. For this moment, it's piercing, subtly wending its way toward questions about who we are and who we want to be.” (Entertainment Weekly) From The New York Times best-selling author of The Mothers, a stunning new novel about twin sisters, inseparable as children, who ultimately choose to live in two very different worlds, one Black and one White. The Vignes twin sisters will always be identical. But after growing up together in a small, Southern Black community and running away at age 16, it's not just the shape of their daily lives that is different as adults, it's everything: their families, their communities, their racial identities. Many years later, one sister lives with her Black daughter in the same Southern town she once tried to escape. The other secretly passes for White, and her White husband knows nothing of her past. Still, even separated by so many miles and just as many lies, the fates of the twins remain intertwined. What will happen to the next generation, when their own daughters' storylines intersect? Weaving together multiple strands and generations of this family, from the Deep South to California, from the 1950s to the 1990s, Brit Bennett produces a story that is at once a riveting, emotional family story and a brilliant exploration of the American history of passing. Looking well beyond issues of race, The Vanishing Half considers the lasting influence of the past as it shapes a person's decisions, desires, and expectations, and explores some of the multiple reasons and realms in which people sometimes feel pulled to live as something other than their origins.  As with her New York Times best-selling debut The Mothers, Brit Bennett offers an engrossing pause-resister about family and relationships that is immersive and provocative, compassionate, and wise.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1qgm2a/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Genre Fiction"],"lastUpdate":1637045254780,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Brit Bennett/The Vanishing Half","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Brit Bennett/The Vanishing Half","addedAt":1637045227223,"lastUpdate":1637045254780,"duration":41646715,"size":508669251,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":13,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":3967.792,"title":"The Vanishing Half-Part01"},{"id":1,"start":3967.792,"end":6922.398,"title":"The Vanishing Half-Part02"},{"id":2,"start":6922.398,"end":9793.282,"title":"The Vanishing Half-Part03"},{"id":3,"start":9793.282,"end":12527.126999999999,"title":"The Vanishing Half-Part04"},{"id":4,"start":12527.126999999999,"end":15144.831999999999,"title":"The Vanishing Half-Part05"},{"id":5,"start":15144.831999999999,"end":19772.764,"title":"The Vanishing Half-Part06"},{"id":6,"start":19772.764,"end":22228.353,"title":"The Vanishing Half-Part07"},{"id":7,"start":22228.353,"end":26505.957,"title":"The Vanishing Half-Part08"},{"id":8,"start":26505.957,"end":29325.718999999997,"title":"The Vanishing Half-Part09"},{"id":9,"start":29325.718999999997,"end":31671.541999999998,"title":"The Vanishing Half-Part10"},{"id":10,"start":31671.541999999998,"end":36267.396,"title":"The Vanishing Half-Part11"},{"id":11,"start":36267.396,"end":39461.232,"title":"The Vanishing Half-Part12"},{"id":12,"start":39461.232,"end":41646.715000000004,"title":"The Vanishing Half-Part13"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1qwda4","ino":"6825458184414338319","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"The Legend of Luke","subtitle":null,"author":"Brian Jacques","authorFL":"Brian Jacques","authorLF":"Jacques, Brian","narrator":"Brian Conn","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2000","publisher":null,"description":null,"isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1qwda4/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Audiobook"],"lastUpdate":1637045984447,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Brian Jacques/The Legend of Luke","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Brian Jacques/The Legend of Luke","addedAt":1637045962415,"lastUpdate":1637045984447,"duration":43841025,"size":287000893,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":9,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":5272.974,"title":"The Legend of Luke - 01"},{"id":1,"start":5272.974,"end":10536.988000000001,"title":"The Legend of Luke - 02"},{"id":2,"start":10536.988000000001,"end":15777.909000000001,"title":"The Legend of Luke - 03"},{"id":3,"start":15777.909000000001,"end":21022.514000000003,"title":"The Legend of Luke - 04"},{"id":4,"start":21022.514000000003,"end":26287.154000000002,"title":"The Legend of Luke - 05"},{"id":5,"start":26287.154000000002,"end":31544.428000000004,"title":"The Legend of Luke - 06"},{"id":6,"start":31544.428000000004,"end":36801.18000000001,"title":"The Legend of Luke - 07"},{"id":7,"start":36801.18000000001,"end":42053.28200000001,"title":"The Legend of Luke - 08"},{"id":8,"start":42053.28200000001,"end":43841.02500000001,"title":"The Legend of Luke - 09"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1qxfdi","ino":"7707427892356292179","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Outcast of Redwall","subtitle":null,"author":"Brian Jacques","authorFL":"Brian Jacques","authorLF":"Jacques, Brian","narrator":"Brian Jacques","series":"Redwall","volumeNumber":"7","publishYear":"1995","publisher":null,"description":"In this stirring, sword-rattling chapter in New York Times best-selling author Brian Jacques' beloved series, questions of right and wrong do not have simple answers.

Now, the eagerly anticipated Words of Radiance continues the epic story and answers many of your questions. Six years ago, the Assassin in White, a hireling of the inscrutable Parshendi, assassinated the Alethi king on the very night a treaty between men and Parshendi was being celebrated. So began the Vengeance Pact among the highprinces of Alethkar and the War of Reckoning against the Parshendi. Now the Assassin is active again, murdering rulers all over the world of Roshar, using his baffling powers to thwart every bodyguard and elude all pursuers. Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar, widely considered the power behind the Alethi throne. His leading role in the war would seem reason enough, but the Assassin's master has much deeper motives. Expected by his enemies to die the miserable death of a military slave, Kaladin survived to be given command of the royal bodyguards, a controversial first for a low-status \"darkeyes.\" Now he must protect the king and Dalinar from every common peril as well as the distinctly uncommon threat of the Assassin, all while secretly struggling to master remarkable new powers that are somehow linked to his honorspren, Syl. Brilliant but troubled Shallan strives along a parallel path. Despite being broken in ways she refuses to acknowledge, she bears a terrible burden: to somehow prevent the return of the legendary Voidbringers and the civilization-ending Desolation that will follow. The secrets she needs can be found at the Shattered Plains, but just arriving there proves more difficult than she could have imagined. Meanwhile, at the heart of the Shattered Plains, the Parshendi are making an epochal decision. Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks, their numbers ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled. The possible consequences for Parshendi and humans alike, indeed, for Roshar itself, are as dangerous as they are incalculable.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw1tsomr/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":"/audiobooks/Brandon Sanderson/The Stormlight Archive 02 -

From the number-one New York Times best-selling author of the Reckoners series, Words of Radiance, the Mistborn trilogy, and the Stormlight Archive comes the second book in an epic series about a girl with a secret in a dangerous world at war for humanity's future. All her life, Spensa has dreamed of becoming a pilot. Of proving she's a hero like her father. She made it to the sky, but the truths she learned about her father were crushing. The rumors of his cowardice are true - he deserted his flight during battle against the Krell. Worse, though, he turned against his team and attacked them.  Spensa is sure there's more to the story. And she's sure that whatever happened to her father in his starship could happen to her. When she made it outside the protective shell of her planet, she heard the stars - and it was terrifying. Everything Spensa has been taught about her world is a lie.  But Spensa also discovered a few other things about herself - and she'll travel to the end of the galaxy to save humankind if she needs to.  \"[A] nonstop, highflying opener.\" (Kirkus Reviews, starred review)  \"With this action-packed trilogy opener, Sanderson offers up a resourceful, fearless heroine and a memorable cast.\" (Publishers Weekly)  \"Sanderson delivers a cinematic adventure that explores the defining aspects of the individual versus the society....

story of political intrigue and magical, martial-arts action. Three hundred years after the events of the Mistborn trilogy, Scadrial is now on the verge of modernity, with railroads to supplement the canals, electric lighting in the streets and the homes of the wealthy, and the first steel-framed skyscrapers racing for the clouds. When family obligations forced Waxillium Ladrian to forsake the frontier lands and return to the metropolis of his birth to take his place as head of a noble House, he little imagined that the crime-fighting skills acquired during 20 years in the dusty plains would be just as applicable in the big city. He soon learned that there, too, just being a talented Twinborn - one who can use both Allomancy and Feruchemy, the dominant magical modes on Scadrial - would not suffice.  This bustling, optimistic, but still shaky society will now face its first test by terrorism and assassination, crimes intended to stir up labor strife and religious conflict. Wax, his eccentric sidekick, Wayne, and brilliant, beautiful young Marasi, now officially part of the constabulary, must unravel the conspiracy before civil strife can stop Scadrial’s progress in its tracks.   Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson: The Cosmere The Stormlight Archive The Way of Kings Words of Radiance Edgedancer (Novella) Oathbringer  The Mistborn trilogy: Mistborn: The Final Empire The Well of Ascension The Hero of Ages Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series: Alloy of Law Shadows of Self Bands of Mourning Collection Arcanum Unbounded Other Cosmere novels: Elantris Warbreaker The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series: Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians The Scrivener's Bones The Knights of Crystallia The Shattered Lens The Dark Talent The Rithmatist series: The Rithmatist Other books by Brandon Sanderson: The Reckoners Steelheart Firefight Calamity","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/s/book/kw1v2hqg/Brandon Sanderson -

My superior Nightingale, previously the last of England's wizardly governmental force, is trying to teach me proper schooling for a magician's apprentice. But even he doesn't have all the answers. Mostly I'm just a constable sworn to enforce the Queen’s Peace, with the occasional help from some unusual friends and a well-placed fire blast. With the new year, I have three main objectives: a) pass the detective exam so I can officially become a DC, b) work out what the hell my relationship with Lesley Mai, an old friend from the force and now fellow apprentice, is supposed to be, and, most importantly, c) get through the year without destroying a major landmark.  Two out of three isn’t bad, right?  A mutilated body in Crawley means another murderer is on the loose. The prime suspect is one Robert Weil, who may either be a common serial killer or an associate of the twisted magician known as the Faceless Man - a man whose previous encounters I've barely survived. I've also got a case about a town planner going under a tube train and another about a stolen grimoire.  But then I get word of something very odd happening in Elephant and Castle, on a housing estate designed by a nutter, built by charlatans, and inhabited by the truly desperate. If there's a connection to the Crawley case, I'll be entering some tricky waters of juristiction with the local river spirits. We have a prickly history, to say the least.  Just the typical day for a magician constable.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw1zh0ae/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Horror"],"lastUpdate":1637060473514,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Ben Aaronovitch/Broken Homes","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Ben Aaronovitch/Broken Homes","addedAt":1637060362711,"lastUpdate":1637060473514,"duration":36077735,"size":287983955,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":20,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":2267.243,"title":"001 - Chapter 01"},{"id":1,"start":2267.243,"end":4171.28,"title":"002 - Chapter 02"},{"id":2,"start":4171.28,"end":5863.644,"title":"003 - Chapter 03"},{"id":3,"start":5863.644,"end":7595.992,"title":"004 - Chapter 04"},{"id":4,"start":7595.992,"end":9151.962,"title":"005 - Chapter 05"},{"id":5,"start":9151.962,"end":10851.71,"title":"006 - Chapter 06"},{"id":6,"start":10851.71,"end":12350.651,"title":"007 - Chapter 07"},{"id":7,"start":12350.651,"end":15062.464,"title":"008 - Chapter 08"},{"id":8,"start":15062.464,"end":16836.748,"title":"009 - Chapter 09"},{"id":9,"start":16836.748,"end":18506.681,"title":"010 - Chapter 10"},{"id":10,"start":18506.681,"end":20107.279000000002,"title":"011 - Chapter 11"},{"id":11,"start":20107.279000000002,"end":22007.276,"title":"012 - Chapter 12"},{"id":12,"start":22007.276,"end":24127.583000000002,"title":"013 - Chapter 13"},{"id":13,"start":24127.583000000002,"end":25763.940000000002,"title":"014 - Chapter 14"},{"id":14,"start":25763.940000000002,"end":27217.510000000002,"title":"015 - Chapter 15"},{"id":15,"start":27217.510000000002,"end":28964.301000000003,"title":"016 - Chapter 16"},{"id":16,"start":28964.301000000003,"end":31234.516000000003,"title":"017 - Chapter 17"},{"id":17,"start":31234.516000000003,"end":33016.834,"title":"018 - Chapter 18"},{"id":18,"start":33016.834,"end":34848.842000000004,"title":"019 - Chapter 19"},{"id":19,"start":34848.842000000004,"end":36077.735,"title":"020 - Chapter 20"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw1zje72","ino":"17872043308998567881","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"A Rare Book of Cunning Device","subtitle":null,"author":"Ben Aaronovitch","authorFL":"Ben Aaronovitch","authorLF":"Aaronovitch, Ben","narrator":"Kobna Holdbrook-Smith","series":null,"volumeNumber":null,"publishYear":"2017","publisher":null,"description":"Exclusive to Audio!

Unfortunately, finding more information isn’t going to be easy. Tristan appears to be entangled with a clandestine organization that calls themselves Whispers. And Corin’s last brush with the Whispers didn’t exactly end well. As much as he wants to follow that lead, Corin has more pressing problems to deal with. Sera is still suffering from a mysterious malady that has stolen her voice and her magic. Corin knows that a portion of that is his fault, and he’s determined to fix it. His mother is still off in another country, and there are growing odds that she’s involved with a conspiracy to overthrow the visages. Corin has also been branded with a new magical mark on his right hand - one that even veteran climbers don’t seem to recognize. He’s going to need to figure out how it works, otherwise it could be more of a vulnerability than an asset. Corin still hasn’t finished his first year at Lorian Heights. If he fails his final exams, he’ll be sent off to the military and lose his chance to investigate his brother’s fate. And finally, there’s the issue of enemies. He might have made a few of them. The biggest problem? He’s not sure if Jin, once one of his closest companions, is one of them.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw201pyd/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy","Fantasy"],"lastUpdate":1637061407391,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Andrew Rowe/On the Shoulders of Titans","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Andrew Rowe/On the Shoulders of Titans","addedAt":1637061329224,"lastUpdate":1637061407391,"duration":89194222,"size":711709144,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":28,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":293.547,"title":"Opening Credits"},{"id":1,"start":293.547,"end":1126.076,"title":"Recap -- Sufficiently Advanced Magic"},{"id":2,"start":1126.076,"end":5225.606,"title":"Chapter I -- Well, That Was Unexpected"},{"id":3,"start":5225.606,"end":7846.071,"title":"Chapter II -- Special Training"},{"id":4,"start":7846.071,"end":11112.562,"title":"Chapter III -- Mismatch"},{"id":5,"start":11112.562,"end":15528.998,"title":"Chapter IV -- Restricted Attunements"},{"id":6,"start":15528.998,"end":20242.231,"title":"Chapter V -- Options"},{"id":7,"start":20242.231,"end":24567.645,"title":"Chapter VI -- Two Heads are Better than One"},{"id":8,"start":24567.645,"end":25629.587,"title":"Chapter VII -- Overdoing It Just a Tad"},{"id":9,"start":25629.587,"end":27677.216,"title":"Chapter VIII -- Sorcery Scars"},{"id":10,"start":27677.216,"end":28185.455,"title":"Chapter IX -- Rest and Recovery"},{"id":11,"start":28185.455,"end":32270.263000000003,"title":"Chapter X -- Difficult Questions"},{"id":12,"start":32270.263000000003,"end":37017.351,"title":"Chapter XI -- A Persistent Hatred for Colored Square Puzzles"},{"id":13,"start":37017.351,"end":39146.946,"title":"Chapter XII -- Lessons Learned"},{"id":14,"start":39146.946,"end":41466.481,"title":"Chapter XIII -- Third Time is the Charm"},{"id":15,"start":41466.481,"end":47098.945999999996,"title":"Chapter XIV -- These Tests Are Never Fair"},{"id":16,"start":47098.945999999996,"end":55014.443,"title":"Chapter XV -- Replacements"},{"id":17,"start":55014.443,"end":57795.823,"title":"Chapter XVI -- And Then Everything Was On Fire"},{"id":18,"start":57795.823,"end":59472.49,"title":"Chapter XVII -- Shots Fired"},{"id":19,"start":59472.49,"end":66787.705,"title":"Chapter XVIII -- Everything That Could Possibly Go Wrong"},{"id":20,"start":66787.705,"end":68536.40000000001,"title":"Chapter XIX -- Emergency Preparedness"},{"id":21,"start":68536.40000000001,"end":74304.09800000001,"title":"Chapter XX -- Ballroom Dancing"},{"id":22,"start":74304.09800000001,"end":78076.64500000002,"title":"Chapter XXI -- Deep Wounds"},{"id":23,"start":78076.64500000002,"end":79298.34000000003,"title":"Chapter XXII -- Unlikely Companions"},{"id":24,"start":79298.34000000003,"end":82796.70500000003,"title":"Chapter XXIII -- Climber"},{"id":25,"start":82796.70500000003,"end":87719.33600000002,"title":"Chapter XXIV -- Scales of the Serpent"},{"id":26,"start":87719.33600000002,"end":87723.09800000003,"title":"Epilogue -- Another Step Forward"},{"id":27,"start":87723.09800000003,"end":89194.22200000002,"title":"End Credits"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw204apz","ino":"6634322279915254134","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Diamantine","subtitle":null,"author":"Andrew Rowe","authorFL":"Andrew Rowe","authorLF":"Rowe, Andrew","narrator":"Nick Podehl","series":"Weapons and Wielders","volumeNumber":"2","publishYear":"2020","publisher":null,"description":"After bonding with Dawnbringer, the Sacred Sword of Light, Keras Selyrian travels to the nation of Edria to compete in the Tournament of the Sacred Sword. The winner of the tournament will be given a chance to fight for the Sacred Sword of Stone if they can defeat the current wielder, the impossibly powerful Emperor of Edria, in single combat. Winning the tournament will be no simple endeavor. To succeed, Keras will have to face representatives from every nation, other foreign travelers of great skill, his own allies, other sacred sword wielders...and even a familiar face from his past. But the tournament itself won't be the only challenge. When tournament contestants are found dead, Keras discovers the telltale signs of a familiar type of enemy - one that even his own formidable powers might fail to match.

But things aren't always what they seem, and safety is a fragile concept when the destructive behaviors of the powerful are exercised unchecked. In Ben's world - like our own - politics, the economy, and military might create a system to keep the elite in power at the expense of the common man.

When a Druid has lived for 2,000 years like Atticus, he's bound to run afoul of a few vampires - make that legions of them. Even his former friend and legal counsel turned out to be a bloodsucking backstabber. Now the toothy troublemakers - led by power-mad pain-in-the-neck Theophilus - have become a huge problem requiring a solution. It's time to make a stand. As always, Atticus wouldn't mind a little backup. But his allies have problems of their own. Ornery archdruid Owen Kennedy is having a wee bit of troll trouble: Turns out when you stiff a troll, it's not water under the bridge. Meanwhile, Granuaile is desperate to free herself of the Norse god Loki's mark and elude his powers of divination - a quest that will bring her face to face with several Slavic nightmares. As Atticus globetrots to stop his nemesis, Theophilus, the journey leads to Rome. What better place to end an immortal than the Eternal City? But poetic justice won't come without a price: In order to defeat Theophilus, Atticus may have to lose an old friend.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw21r5na/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Literature & Fiction","Action & Adventure"],"lastUpdate":1637087695259,"lastCoverSearch":null,"lastCoverSearchTitle":null,"lastCoverSearchAuthor":null},"tags":[],"path":"Kevin Hearne/Iron Druid/08 - Staked","fullPath":"/audiobooks/Kevin Hearne/Iron Druid/08 - Staked","addedAt":1637064195640,"lastUpdate":1637087695259,"duration":40503032,"size":321965094,"ebooks":[],"numEbooks":0,"numTracks":1,"chapters":[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":2120.306,"title":"Chapter 001"},{"id":1,"start":2120.306,"end":2964.352,"title":"Chapter 002"},{"id":2,"start":2964.352,"end":3786.013,"title":"Chapter 003"},{"id":3,"start":3786.013,"end":5248.824,"title":"Chapter 004"},{"id":4,"start":5248.824,"end":7440.555,"title":"Chapter 005"},{"id":5,"start":7440.555,"end":8558.225,"title":"Chapter 006"},{"id":6,"start":8558.225,"end":10512.416,"title":"Chapter 007"},{"id":7,"start":10512.416,"end":11905.102,"title":"Chapter 008"},{"id":8,"start":11905.102,"end":13059.274,"title":"Chapter 009"},{"id":9,"start":13059.274,"end":13771.337,"title":"Chapter 010"},{"id":10,"start":13771.337,"end":15894.244,"title":"Chapter 011"},{"id":11,"start":15894.244,"end":18254.831,"title":"Chapter 012"},{"id":12,"start":18254.831,"end":21045.87,"title":"Chapter 013"},{"id":13,"start":21045.87,"end":21717.252,"title":"Chapter 014"},{"id":14,"start":21717.252,"end":23468.408,"title":"Chapter 015"},{"id":15,"start":23468.408,"end":25622.291,"title":"Chapter 016"},{"id":16,"start":25622.291,"end":26306.861,"title":"Chapter 017"},{"id":17,"start":26306.861,"end":28242.105,"title":"Chapter 018"},{"id":18,"start":28242.105,"end":29993.726,"title":"Chapter 019"},{"id":19,"start":29993.726,"end":31466.289,"title":"Chapter 020"},{"id":20,"start":31466.289,"end":32920.183,"title":"Chapter 021"},{"id":21,"start":32920.183,"end":33508.855,"title":"Chapter 022"},{"id":22,"start":33508.855,"end":34091.258,"title":"Chapter 023"},{"id":23,"start":34091.258,"end":35175.63,"title":"Chapter 024"},{"id":24,"start":35175.63,"end":35976.997,"title":"Chapter 025"},{"id":25,"start":35976.997,"end":38668.004,"title":"Chapter 026"},{"id":26,"start":38668.004,"end":39732.082,"title":"Chapter 027"},{"id":27,"start":39732.082,"end":40503.032,"title":"Staked"}],"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"hasMissingParts":0,"hasInvalidParts":0},{"id":"kw21ra3g","ino":"7081079509451136688","libraryId":"main","folderId":"audiobooks","book":{"title":"Hunted","subtitle":null,"author":"Kevin Hearne","authorFL":"Kevin Hearne","authorLF":"Hearne, Kevin","narrator":"Luke Daniels","series":"Iron Druid","volumeNumber":"6","publishYear":"2013","publisher":null,"description":"For a 2,000-year-old Druid, Atticus O’Sullivan is a pretty fast runner.

His usual magical option of shifting planes is blocked, so instead of playing hide-and-seek, the game plan is...run like hell. Crashing the pantheon marathon is the Norse god Loki.

world is broken.... Corban wants nothing more than to be a warrior under King Brenin's rule - to protect and serve. But that day will come all too soon. And the price he pays will be in blood.  Evnis has sacrificed - too much it seems. But what he wants - the power to rule - will soon be in his grasp. And nothing will stop him once he has started on his path.  Veradis is the newest member of the warband for the High Prince, Nathair. He is one of the most skilled swordsman to come out of his homeland, yet he is always under the shadow of his older brother.  Nathair has ideas - and a lot of plans. Many of them don't involve his father, the High King Aquilus. Nor does he agree with his father's idea to summon his fellow kings to council.  The Banished Lands has a violent past where armies of men and giants clashed in battle, but now giants are seen, the stones weep blood, and giant wyrms are stirring. Those who can still read the signs see a threat far greater than the ancient wars. For if the Black Sun gains ascendancy, mankind's hopes and dreams will fall to dust.... ...and it can never be made whole again. Malice is a dark epic fantasy tale of blind greed, ambition, and betrayal.","isbn":null,"language":null,"cover":"/metadata/books/kw23ry5r/cover.jpg","coverFullPath":null,"genres":["Science Fiction &

Everyone knows the tales of the Orb protecting the West from the evil god Torak are just silly legends. But here she is, forced to join a dangerous quest to recover that stolen Orb. No one believes in sorcery, but Garion's aunt and grandfather seem to be the fabled sorcerers Polgara and Belgarath, who would have to be thousands of years old. Even young Garion is learning to do sorcery. He's just a farm boy, totally unsuitable for an Imperial Princess. Yet for some reason, she has the urge to teach him, brush back his tangled hair, and comfort him. But he is going to a strange tower in the center of all he believes evil, to face some horrible, powerful magician, and she can't be there to watch over him. She may never see him again!

But as a mere scullery boy in service of the fabled Ardent Lunar Sect, his chances of rising through the ranks are slim. There is only one way he can take up the title of cultivator - to awaken before he comes of age. Time is already running out.

There he unearths the mysteries of an ancient, long-forgotten sect - whose secrets offer hope - and the chance for Falken to develop powers that none have seen in an age. But Falken’s newfound powers may not be enough, for nightmare creatures, dark assassins and even the undead stalk the lands of Netherdei.
